          <p>Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes (PBH) with masses ranging from
$\sim 10^{-1}$ to $\sim 10^9$ g can generate the whole observed dark matter
(DM) relic density. However, a second DM production mechanism, like freeze-out
or freeze-in, could have also been active in the early universe. Here we study
the interplay of these mechanisms, focusing on the scenario where PBHs dominate
the energy density of the universe, leading to a nonstandard cosmological era.
For concreteness, we use the singlet scalar DM model as an example for this

          <p>Prior to the epoch of reionisation, the 21-cm signal of the cosmic dawn is
dominated by the Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling and gas temperature fluctuations
caused by the first sources of radiation. While early efforts to model this
epoch relied on analytical techniques, the community quickly transitioned to
more expensive semi-numerical models. Here, we re-assess the viability of
simpler approaches that allow for rapid explorations of the vast astrophysical
parameter space. We propose a new analytical method to calculate the 21-cm
power spectrum based on the framework of the halo model. Both the
Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling and temperature fluctuations are described by
overlapping radiation flux profiles that include spectral red-shifting and
source attenuation due to look-back (light-cone) effects. The 21-cm halo model
is compared to the semi-numerical code 21cmFAST exhibiting generally good
agreement, i.e., the power spectra differ by less than a factor of three over a
large range of $k$-modes and redshifts. We show that the remaining differences
between the two methods are comparable to the expected variations from
modelling uncertainties associated with the abundance, bias, and accretion
rates of haloes. While these current uncertainties must be reduced in the
future, our work suggests that inference at acceptable accuracy will become
feasible with very efficient halo models of the cosmic dawn.

          <p>Flavor universal neutrino self-interaction have been shown to ease the
tension in the measurements of Hubble constant between the early and late
Universe data. We introduce a self-interaction structure that is
flavor-specific in the three active neutrino framework. This is motivated by
stringent constraints on new secret interactions among electron and muon
neutrinos from several laboratory experiments. Our study indicates the presence
of a strongly interaction mode which implies a late-decoupling of the neutrinos
just prior to matter radiation equality. Using the degeneracy of the coupling
strength with other cosmological parameters, we explain the origin of this new
mode as a result of better fit to certain features in the CMB data. We find
that if only one or two of the three active neutrino flavors are interacting,
then the statistical significance of the strongly-interacting neutrino mode
increases substantially relative to the flavor universal case. However, the
central value of the coupling strength for this interaction mode does not
change by a appreciable amount in flavor-specific cases.

          <p>Recent measurements of the parameters of the Concordance Cosmology Model
($\Lambda$CDM) done in the low-redshift Universe with Supernovae Ia/Cepheids,
and in the distant Universe done with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) imply
different values for the Hubble constant (67.4 $\pm$ 0.5 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$
from Planck vs 74.03 $\pm$ 1.42 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, Riess et al. 2019).
This Hubble constant tension implies that either the systematic errors are
underestimated, or the $\Lambda$CDM does not represent well the observed
expansion of the Universe. Since quasars - active galactic nuclei - can be
observed in the nearby Universe up to redshift z $\sim$ 7.5, they are suitable
to estimate the cosmological properties in a large redshift range. Our group
develops two methods based on the observations of quasars in the late Universe
up to redshift z$\sim $4.5, with the objective to determine the expansion rate
of the Universe. These methods do not yet provide an independent measurement of
the Hubble constant since they do not have firm absolute calibration but they
allow to test the $\Lambda$CDM model, and so far no departures from this model

plagued by the presence of a large number of artifacts (e.g., objects blended
in the diffuse light from stars and galaxies, Galactic cirrus, star-forming
regions in the arms of spiral galaxies, etc.) that have to be rejected through
time consuming visual inspection. In future surveys, which are expected to
collect hundreds of petabytes of data and detect billions of objects, such an
approach will not be feasible. We investigate the use of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) for the problem of separating LSBGs from artifacts in survey

available a large number of labeled LSBGs and artifacts from the Dark Energy
Survey, that we use to train, validate, and test a CNN model. That model, which
we call DeepShadows, achieves a test accuracy of $92.0 \%$, a significant
improvement relative to feature-based machine learning models. We also study
the ability to use transfer learning to adapt this model to classify objects
from the deeper Hyper-Suprime-Cam survey, and we show that after the model is
retrained on a very small sample from the new survey, it can reach an accuracy
of $87.6\%$. These results demonstrate that CNNs offer a very promising path in

          <p>A significant challenge for modelling the massive neutrino as a hot dark
matter is its large velocity dispersion. In this work, we investigate and
implement a multi-fluid perturbation theory that treats the cosmic neutrino
population as a collection of fluids with a broad range of bulk velocities.
These fluids respond linearly to the clustering of cold matter, which may be
linear and described by standard linear perturbation theory, or non-linear,
described using either higher-order perturbation theory or N-body simulations.
We verify that such an alternative treatment of neutrino perturbations agrees
closely with state-of-the-art neutrino linear response calculations in terms of
power spectrum and bispectrum predictions. Combining multi-fluid neutrino
linear response with a non-linear calculation for the cold matter clustering,
we find for a reference nuLambdaCDM cosmology with neutrino mass sum of 0.93 eV
an enhancement of the small-scale neutrino power by an order of magnitude
relative to a purely linear calculation. The corresponding clustering
enhancement in the cold matter, however, is a modest ~0.05%. Importantly, our
multi-fluid approach uniquely enables us to identify that the slowest-moving
25% of the neutrino population clusters strongly enough to warrant a non-linear
treatment. Such a precise calculation of neutrino clustering on small scales
accompanied by fine-grained velocity information would be invaluable for
experiments such as PTOLEMY that probe the local neutrino density and velocity
in the solar neighbourhood.

          <p>We present in this work a novel and yet extremely simple method for
incorporating the effects of massive neutrinos in cosmological $N$-body
simulations. This so-called "SuperEasy linear response" approach is based upon
analytical solutions to the collisionless Boltzmann equation in the clustering
and free-streaming limits, which are then connected by a rational function
interpolation function with cosmology-dependent coefficients given by simple
algebraic expressions of the cosmological model parameters. The outcome is a
{\it one-line modification} to gravitational potential that requires only the
cold matter density contrast as a real-time input, and that can be incorporated
into any $N$-body code with a Particle--Mesh component with no additional
implementation cost. To demonstrate its power, we implement the SuperEasy
method in the publicly available \gadgetcode{} code, and show that for neutrino
mass sums not exceeding $\sum m_\nu \simeq 1$ eV, the total matter and cold
matter power spectra are in sub-1% and sub-0.1% agreement with those from
state-of-the-art linear response simulations in literature. Aside from its
minimal implementation cost, compared with existing massive neutrino simulation
methods, the SuperEasy approach has better memory efficiency, incurs no runtime
overhead relative to a standard $\Lambda$CDM simulation, and requires no
post-processing. The minimal nature of the method allows limited computational
resources to be diverted to modelling other physical effects of interest, e.g.,
baryonic physics via hydrodynamics.

          <p>The total red shift $z$ might be recast as a combination of the expansion red
shift and a static shift due to the energy-momentum tensor non-conservation of
a photon propagating through Electro-Magnetic (EM) fields. If massive, the
photon may be described by the de Broglie-Proca (dBP) theory which satisfies
the Lorentz(-Poincar\'e) Symmetry (LoSy) but not gauge-invariance. The latter
is regained in the Standard-Model Extension (SME), associated with LoSy
Violation (LSV) that naturally dresses photons of a mass. The non-conservation
stems from the vacuum expectation value of the vector and tensor LSV fields.
The final colour (red or blue) and size of the static shift depend on the
orientations and strength of the LSV and EM multiple fields encountered along
the path of the photon. Turning to cosmology, for a zero $\Omega_{\Lambda}$
energy density, the discrepancy between luminosity and red shift distances of
SNeIa disappears thanks to the recasting of $z$. Massive photons induce an
effective dark energy acting `optically' but not dynamically.

This interaction is owing to the Primakoff effect. Adopting the zero mode
approximation for axions, we derive the system of equations for axions and
magnetic fields, where the expansion of the universe and the spectra of
magnetic fields are accounted for exactly. We find that the contribution of the
Primakoff effect to the dynamics of axions and magnetic fields is rather weak.
It confirms some previous estimates leading to analogous conclusions, when
accounting here for the Hubble expansion both for an uniform axion field and
non-uniform PMFs using Fourier spectra for their energy and helicity densities.
We solve the corresponding system of the evolution equations and find that the
axion zero mode, when evolving during radiation era, has its amplitude at the

a function of density level, and their evolution with cosmic epoch reflects the
changing network connections between these structural features. The persistence
diagrams quantify the longevity and stability of topological features. In this
study we establish, for the first time, the link between persistence diagrams,

link between the multiscale topology of the cosmic web and the hierarchical
buildup of cosmic structure is established. The sharp apexes in the diagrams
are intimately related to key transitions in the structure formation process.
The apex in the matter concentration diagrams coincides with the density level
at which, typically, they detach from the Hubble expansion and begin to
collapse. At that level many individual islands merge to form the network of
the cosmic web and a large number of filaments and tunnels emerge to establish
its connecting bridges. The location trends of the apex possess a self-similar
character that can be related to the cosmic web's hierarchical buildup. We find
that persistence diagrams provide a significantly higher and more profound
level of information on the structure formation process than more global
summary statistics like Euler characteristic or Betti numbers.

          <p>We investigate first order phase transitions in a holographic setting of
five-dimensional Einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field, constructing phase
diagrams of the dual field theory at finite temperature. We scan over the
two-dimensional parameter space of a simple bottom-up model and map out
important quantities for the phase transition: the region where first order
phase transitions take place; the latent heat, the transition strength
parameter $\alpha$, and the stiffness. We find that $\alpha$ is generically in
the range 0.1 to 0.3, and is strongly correlated with the stiffness (the square
of the sound speed in a barotropic fluid). Using the LISA Cosmology Working
Group gravitational wave power spectrum model corrected for kinetic energy
suppression at large $\alpha$ and non-conformal stiffness, we outline the
observational prospects at the future space-based detectors LISA and TianQin. A
TeV-scale hidden sector with a phase transition described by the model could be

field $\sigma$ with a non-minimal coupling to the Ricci curvature of the type
$M^2_{\rm pl}+\xi \sigma^2$ plus a cosmological constant and a small effective
mass and demonstrate its ability to alleviate the $H_0$ tension while providing
a good fit to Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies and Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data. In this model the scalar field, frozen deep
in the radiation era, grows around the redshift of matter-radiation equality
because of the coupling to non-relativistic matter. The small effective mass,
which we consider here as induced by a quartic potential, then damps the scalar
field into coherent oscillations around its minimum at $\sigma=0$, leading to a
weaker gravitational strength at early times and naturally recovering the
consistency with laboratory and Solar System tests of gravity. We analyze the
capability of EMG with positive $\xi$ to fit current cosmological observations
and compare our results to the case without an effective mass and to the
popular early dark energy models with $\xi=0$. We show that EMG with a quartic
coupling of the order of $\lambda\sim\mathcal{O}({\rm eV}^4/M_{\rm pl}^4)$ can
substantially alleviate the $H_0$ tension also when the full shape of the

          <p>The standard cosmological model is inherently relativistic, and yet a wide
range of cosmological observations can be predicted accurately from essentially
Newtonian theory. This is not the case on `ultra-large' distance scales, around
the cosmic horizon size, however, where relativistic effects can no longer be
neglected. In this paper, we present a novel suite of 53 fully relativistic
simulations generated using the gevolution code, each covering the full sky out
to $z \approx$ 0.85, and approximately 1930 square degrees out to $z \approx$
3.55. These include a relativistic treatment of massive neutrinos, as well as
the gravitational potential that can be used to exactly calculate observables
on the past light cone. The simulations are divided into two sets, the first
being a set of 39 simulations of the same fiducial cosmology (based on the
Euclid Flagship 2 cosmology) with different realisations of the initial
conditions, and the second which fixes the initial conditions, but varies each
of seven cosmological parameters in turn. Taken together, these simulations
allow us to perform statistical studies and calculate derivatives of any
relativistic observable with respect to cosmological parameters. As an example
application, we compute the cross-correlation between the Doppler magnification
term in the convergence, $\kappa_v$, and the CDM+baryon density contrast,
$\delta_{\rm cb}$, which arises only in a (special) relativistic treatment. We
are able to accurately recover this term as predicted by relativistic
perturbation theory, and study its sample variance and derivatives with respect
to cosmological parameters.

universe can undergo a non-singular bounce, i.e., smoothly transit from a
period of contraction to a period of expansion through violation of the null
energy condition (NEC) at energies well below the Planck scale and at finite
values of the scale factor such that the entire evolution remains classical. A
common claim has been that a non-singular bounce either leads to ghost or
gradient instabilities or a cosmological singularity. In this letter, we
examine cubic Galileon theories and present a procedure for explicitly
constructing examples of a non-singular cosmological bounce without

          <p>The Euclid space telescope will measure the shapes and redshifts of galaxies
to reconstruct the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of cosmic
structures. Estimation of the expected performance of the experiment, in terms
of predicted constraints on cosmological parameters, has so far relied on
different methodologies and numerical implementations, developed for different
observational probes and for their combination. In this paper we present
validated forecasts, that combine both theoretical and observational expertise
for different cosmological probes. This is presented to provide the community
with reliable numerical codes and methods for Euclid cosmological forecasts. We
describe in detail the methodology adopted for Fisher matrix forecasts, applied
to galaxy clustering, weak lensing and their combination. We estimate the
required accuracy for Euclid forecasts and outline a methodology for their
development. We then compare and improve different numerical implementations,
reaching uncertainties on the errors of cosmological parameters that are less
than the required precision in all cases. Furthermore, we provide details on
the validated implementations that can be used by the reader to validate their
own codes if required. We present new cosmological forecasts for Euclid. We
find that results depend on the specific cosmological model and remaining
freedom in each setup, i.e. flat or non-flat spatial cosmologies, or different
cuts at nonlinear scales. The validated numerical implementations can now be
reliably used for any setup. We present results for an optimistic and a
pessimistic choice of such settings. We demonstrate that the impact of
cross-correlations is particularly relevant for models beyond a cosmological
constant and may allow us to increase the dark energy Figure of Merit by at
least a factor of three.

gravitational wave signal from preheating after inflation rests on the in-in
formalism. We extend here our previous analysis to include the backreaction of
the produced matter on the motion of the inflaton and the expansion of the
universe, and study how the latter affect the spectrum of the resulting
gravitational waves. The addition of backreaction demands the appropriate
renormalization of divergent expectation values, which we regularize by
preserving diffeomorphism invariance in a manner that is amenable to numerical
integration. The very same calculation also allows us to determine for which
strength of the inflaton to matter couplings reheating is successful. We
illustrate our results with the scalar version of the Starobinsky model of
inflation, and observe that it is hard to reheat the universe while keeping
radiative corrections under control.

theory of gravitation, based on a stringy action in the teleparallel gravity
which includes a specific functional which depends on the scalar field and its
kinetic energy, as well as the torsion and boundary terms, embedding also
possible effects from the teleparallel Gauss--Bonnet invariants. We focus our
study on FLRW cosmology. After we deduce the cosmological equations for the
associated generic theory of gravitation, we focus on string inspired couplings
which are studied by considering different analytical techniques. The first
analytical technique is based on the linear stability theory, by introducing
proper dimensionless variables which enables us to study the structure of the
phase space and the associated physical effects. In this case, we have obtained
different cosmological solutions which correspond to matter and dark energy
dominated solutions, achieving a possible transition between matter and dark
energy dominated epochs. For each type of cosmological solutions, we have
discussed the corresponding physical features, attaining viable constraints for
the coupling constants due to dynamical effects. The dynamical study of the
physical features included also a numerical analysis by fine--tuning the
initial conditions deep into the matter era, obtaining possible trajectories
for the effective equation of state for specific coupling functions.

          <p>We study the possibility to obtain cosmological late-time acceleration from a
geometry changing with the scale, in particular, in the so-called
multifractional theories with $q$-derivatives and with weighted derivatives. In
the theory with $q$-derivatives, the luminosity distance is the same as in
general relativity and, therefore, geometry cannot act as dark energy. In the
theory with weighted derivatives, geometry alone is able to sustain a late-time
acceleration phase without fine tuning, while being compatible with
structure-formation and big-bang nucleosynthesis bounds. This suggests to
extend the theory, in a natural way, from just small-scale to also large-scale
modifications of gravity. Surprisingly, the Hausdorff dimension of spacetime is
constrained to be close to the topological dimension 4. After arguing that this
finding might not be a numerical coincidence, we conclude that present-day
acceleration could be regarded as the effect of a new restoration law for
spacetime geometry.

annihilation cross section in the Galactic center for DM particle masses in the
range of 1-500 GeV. We obtained the sensitivity gain at least by 1.2-1.5 times
(depending on DM particle mass) with respect to the expected constraints from
12 years of observations by Fermi-LAT for the case of Einasto DM density

up to 1.8-2.3 times. Thus the sensitivity reaches the level of annihilation

will allow us to test the hypothesized narrow lines predicted by specific DM

also considered the decaying DM - in this case the joint analysis may yield the
sensitivity gain up to 1.1-2.0 times reaching the level of DM lifetime
$\tau_{\gamma\nu}(m_\chi=100~\mbox{GeV}) \approx 2\cdot 10^{29}$ s. We

          <p>Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs) are strongly motivated by theory due to their
capability of simultaneously explaining the observed phenomena of dark matter,
neutrino oscillations and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. The existence
of such particles would affect the expansion history of the Universe and the
synthesis of primordial abundances of light elements. In this work we review,
revise and extend the phenomenology of HNLs during the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
(BBN) epoch for masses up to 1 GeV. This is of great importance, as BBN is able
to provide complementary bounds to those from upcoming and proposed laboratory
experiments. To this end we have developed a high-precision Boltzmann code that
simulates BBN in the presence of HNLs and takes into account all relevant HNL
decay channels, as well as subsequent interactions of decay products
(thermalization and decay showers), dilution due to QCD phase transition,
active neutrino oscillations and corrections to the weak reaction rates. We
present robust bounds on the lifetime and mixing angles of HNLs for masses
$3\,\mathrm{MeV}\leq m_N \leq 1\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and show that BBN is able to
constrain HNL lifetimes down to $0.03 - 0.05$ s, depending on the mixing
pattern. Moreover, combining our results with current experimental searches, we
can exclude HNLs that mix purely with electron neutrinos up to ${\sim}$450 MeV
and those that mix purely with muon neutrinos up to ${\sim}$360 MeV, in both
cases for lifetimes up to at least a few tens of seconds. Finally, we compare
the BBN constraints with those obtained from Cosmic Microwave Background

          <p>Whereas cold dark matter (CDM) simulations predict central dark matter cusps
with densities that diverge as $\rho$(r)$\sim$ 1/r observations often indicate
constant density cores with finite central densities $\rho_0$ and a flat
density distribution within a core radius r$_0$. This paper investigates
whether this core-cusp problem can be solved by fuzzy dark matter (FDM), a
hypothetical particle with a mass of order m$\approx$10$^{-22}$eV and a
corresponding de Broglie wavelength on astrophysical scales. We show that
galaxies with CDM halo virial masses M$_{vir} \leq 10^{11}$M$_{\odot}$ follow
two core scaling relations. In addition to the well known universal core column
density $\Sigma_0 \equiv \rho_0 \times$r$_0$ = 75 M$_{\odot}$pc$^{-2}$ core
radii increase with virial masses as r$_0 \sim$ M$_{vir}^{\gamma}$ with
$\gamma$ of order unity. Using the simulations by Schive et al. (2014) we
demonstrate that FDM can explain the r$_0$-M$_{vir}$ scaling relation if the
virial masses of the observed galaxy sample scale with formation redshift z as
M$_{vir}\sim$(1+z)$^{-0.4}$. The observed constant $\Sigma_0$ is however in
complete disagreement with FDM cores which are characterised by a steep
dependence $\Sigma_0 \sim$r$_0^{-3}$, independent of z. More high-resolution
simulations are now required to confirm the Schive et al. simulations and
explore especially the transition region between the soliton core and the
surrounding halo. If these results hold, FDM can be ruled out as the origin of
observed dark matter cores and other physical processes are required to account
for their formation.

          <p>Cosmic voids provide a powerful probe of the origin and evolution of
structures in the Universe because their dynamics can remain near-linear to the
present day. As a result they have the potential to connect large scale
structure at late times to early-Universe physics. Existing "watershed"-based
algorithms, however, define voids in terms of their morphological properties at
low redshift. The degree to which the resulting regions exhibit linear dynamics
is consequently uncertain, and there is no direct connection to their evolution
from the initial density field. A recent void definition addresses these issues
by considering "anti-halos". This approach consists of inverting the initial
conditions of an $N$-body simulation to swap overdensities and underdensities.
After evolving the pair of initial conditions, anti-halos are defined by the
particles within the inverted simulation that are inside halos in the original
(uninverted) simulation. In this work, we quantify the degree of non-linearity
of both anti-halos and watershed voids using the Zel'dovich approximation. We
find that non-linearities are introduced by voids with radii less than
$5\,\mathrm{Mpc}\,h^{-1}$, and that both anti-halos and watershed voids can be
made into highly linear sets by removing these voids.

          <p>We model the gravitational-wave background created by double compact objects
from isolated binary evolution across cosmic time using the
\textbf{\textit{StarTrack}} binary population code. We include Population I/II
stars as well as metal-free Population III stars. Merging and non-merging
double compact object binaries are taken into account. In order to model the
low frequency signal in the band of the space antenna LISA, we account for the
evolution of the redshift and the eccentricity. We find an energy density of
$\Omega_{GW} \sim 7.5 \times 10^{-10}$ at the reference frequency of 25 Hz for
population I/II only, making the background detectable after $\sim$5.5 years of
observation with the current generation of ground based detectors, such as
LIGO, Virgo and Kagra, operating at design sensitivity. Adding the contribution
from population III increases the energy density to $\Omega_{GW} \sim 1.4
\times 10^{-8}$, and also modifies the shape of the spectrum which starts
deviating from the usual power law $\Omega_{GW}(f) \sim f^{2/3}$ after $\sim
10$ Hz. The contribution from the population of non merging binaries, on the
other hand, is negligible, being orders of magnitude below. Finally, we observe
that the eccentricity has no impact in the frequency band of LISA or ground
based detectors.

          <p>We study the influence of lepton flavour asymmetries on the formation and the
mass spectrum of primordial black holes. We estimate the detectability of their
mergers with LIGO/Virgo and show that the currently published gravitational
wave events may actually be described by a primordial black hole spectrum from
non-zero asymmetries. We suggest to use gravitational-wave astronomy as a novel
tool to probe how lepton flavour asymmetric the Universe has been before the
onset of neutrino oscillations.

          <p>We consider the framework of quintessential inflation in the warm background
which is caused by the dissipation of the scalar field energy density into
relativistic degrees of freedom. The dissipation process has important
consequences for the evolution both at the levels of background as well as
perturbation and allows us to easily satisfy the observational constraints.~Our
numerical analysis confirms that the model conforms to observational
constraints even if the field-radiation coupling strength is weak. In the warm
background, we investigate the post inflationary evolution of relic gravity
waves produced during inflation whose amplitude is constrained by the Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis constraint. Further, we investigate the effect of coupling on
the amplitude of gravity waves and obtain the allowed phase space between the
model parameters. The mechanism of quintessential inflation gives rise to the
blue spectrum of gravitational wave background at high frequencies. We discuss
the perspectives of detection of the signal of relic gravity waves by future
proposed missions. Improvements of their sensitivities in the high-frequency
regime, in the future, might allow us to probe the blue tilt of the spectrum
caused by the presence of a kinetic regime in the underlying framework of
inflation.

          <p>Dark sectors with purely gravitational couplings to the Standard Model are
unavoidably populated from the SM plasma by graviton exchange, and naturally
provide DM candidates. We examine the production in the relativistic regime
where the dark sector is approximately scale invariant, providing general
analytical formulas that depend solely on the central charge of the dark
sector. We then assess the relevance of interactions that can lead to a variety
of phenomena including thermalisation, nonperturbative mass gaps,
out-of-equilibrium phase transitions and cannibalism in the dark sector. As an
illustrative example we consider the dark glueball scenario in this light and
show it to be a viable DM candidate due to the suppression of gravitational
production. We go on to extend these results to strongly coupled CFTs and their
holographic duals at large-N with the dark dilaton as the DM candidate.
