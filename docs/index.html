          <p>A union of matter bounce and Ekpyrotic scenarios is often studied in an
attempt to combine the most promising features of these two models. Since
non-perturbative quantum geometric effects in loop quantum cosmology (LQC)
result in natural bouncing scenarios without any violation of energy conditions
or fine tuning, an investigation of matter-Ekpyrotic bounce scenario is
interesting to explore in this quantum gravitational setting. In this work, we
explore this unified phenomenological model for a spatially flat
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe in LQC filled with dust
and a scalar field in an Ekpyrotic scenario like negative potential. Background
dynamics and the power spectrum of the comoving curvature perturbations are
numerically analyzed with various initial conditions and a suitable choice of
the initial states. By varying the initial conditions we consider different
cases of dust and Ekpyrotic field domination in the contracting phase. We use
the dressed metric approach to numerically compute the primordial power
spectrum of the comoving curvature perturbations which turns out to be almost
scale invariant for the modes which exit the horizon in the matter-dominated
phase. But, in contrast with a constant magnitude power spectrum obtained under
approximation of a constant Ekpyrotic equation of state using deformed algebra
approach in an earlier work, we find that the magnitude of power spectrum
changes during evolution. Our analysis shows that the bouncing regime only
leaves imprints on the modes outside the scale-invariant regime. However, an
analysis of the spectral index shows inconsistency with the observational data,
thus making further improvements in such a model necessary.

          <p>The success of primordial nucleosynthesis as a cornerstone of the hot Big
Bang model has been limited by the long-standing lithium problem. Recent work
presented a self-consistent perturbative analysis of the effects of variations
in nature's fundamental constants on primordial nucleosynthesis for a broad
class of grand unified theory models, showing that such models provide a
possible solution to the lithium problem, provided the value of the
fine-structure constant $\alpha$ at the nucleosynthesis epoch is larger than
the current laboratory one by a few parts per million of relative variation.
Here we extend the earlier analysis, focusing on how this preferred value of
$\alpha$ is affected if relevant cosmological parameters are also allowed to
vary--specifically focusing on the baryon-to-photon ratio, the number of
neutrinos, and the neutron lifetime. We rephrase the lithium problem in terms
of the values of these parameters that would be needed to solve it within this
class of grand unified theories, thus obtaining values that would disagree with
the results of other experiments by several standard deviations. Using these
experimental results as priors in the analysis, we find that a larger value of
$\alpha$ is still preferred, confirming our previous results. By excluding
lithium from the analysis, we also obtain upper limits on possible variations
of $\alpha$ at the primordial nucleosynthesis epoch. At the two-sigma level,
these are $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|&lt;50$ ppm without nuclear physics, cosmology, or
atomic clocks priors, or alternatively $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|&lt;5$ ppm if these
priors are used. While the simplest solution to the lithium problem is likely
to be found within observational astrophysics, our work shows that varying
fundamental constants remain a viable alternative.

          <p>We measure the Voronoi density probability distribution function (PDF) for
both dark matter and halos in N-body simulations. For the dark matter, Voronoi
densities represent the matter density field smoothed on a uniform mass scale,
which approximates the Lagrangian density field. For halos, the Voronoi
densities contain information about the local environment of each halo. We
measure the halo virial masses, the total amount of dark matter within each
halo Voronoi cell, and the halo Voronoi cell volumes, and we show how halo
abundances depend on these three quantities. We then study the
position-dependent Voronoi density PDF, measured within finite subregions of
the Universe, using separate universe simulations. We demonstrate that the
spatial variation of the position-dependent PDF is due to large-scale density
fluctuations, indicating that the position-dependent PDF is a biased tracer of
large-scale structure. We measure this bias for the dark matter, and interpret
it as the bias of regions of the Lagrangian density field that are selected
based on density. For the halos, this bias can be interpreted as a form of
assembly bias. We present the mapping from late-time to early-time Voronoi
density for each simulation dark matter particle, which is highly stochastic.
We compare the median of this stochastic map with spherical collapse
calculations and discuss challenges involved in modeling the evolution of the
density field on these scales.

          <p>We present a comparative analysis of observational low-redshift background
constraints on three candidate models for explaining the low-redshift
acceleration of the universe. The generalized coupling model by Feng and
Carloni and the scale invariant model by Maeder (both of which can be
interpreted as bimetric theories) are compared to the traditional
parametrization of Chevallier, Polarski and Linder. In principle the
generalized coupling model, which in vacuum is equivalent to General
Relativity, contains two types of vacuum energy: the usual cosmological
constant plus a second contribution due to the matter fields. We show that the
former is necessary for the model to agree with low-redshift observations,
while there is no statistically significant evidence for the presence of the
second. On the other hand the scale invariant model effectively has a
time-dependent cosmological constant. In this case we show that a matter
density $\Omega_m\sim0.3$ is a relatively poor fit to the data, and the
best-fit model would require a fluid with a much smaller density and a
significantly positive equation of state parameter.

dominated by a bath of dark radiation. Within current constraints this
radiation could have up to $\sim 10^4$ times more energy density than the
cosmic microwave background. We demonstrate particular models in which a
rolling scalar field generates different forms of dark radiation such as hidden
photons, milli-charged particles and even Standard Model neutrinos. We find the
leading effect on the late-time cosmological expansion history depends on a
single parameter beyond $\Lambda$CDM, namely the temperature of the dark
radiation today. Cosmological observations of this modified expansion rate
could provide a striking signature of this scenario. The dark radiation itself

spatially flat radiation dominated cosmology. We consider a model of scalar
particles to study scattering and heavy particle production from pair
annihilation, drawing more general conclusions. The S-matrix formulation is ill
suited to study these ubiquitous processes in a rapidly expanding cosmology. We
introduce a physically motivated adiabatic expansion that relies on wavelengths
much smaller than the particle horizon at a given time. The leading order in
this expansion dominates the transition rates and cross sections. Several
important and general results are direct consequences of the cosmological
redshift and a finite particle horizon: i) a violation of local Lorentz
invariance, ii) freeze-out of the production cross section at a finite time,
iii) sub-threshold production of heavier particles as a consequence of the
uncertainty in the local energy from a finite particle horizon, a manifestation
of the \emph{antizeno} effect. If heavy dark matter is produced via
annihilation of a lighter species, sub-threshold production yields an enhanced
abundance. We discuss several possible consequences of these effects.

          <p>We explore cosmological implications of a genuinely Weyl invariant (WI)
gravitational interaction. The latter reduces to general relativity in a
particular conformal frame for which the gravitational coupling and active
gravitational masses are fixed. Specifically, we consider a cosmological model
in this framework that is {\it dynamically} identical to the standard model
(SM) of cosmology. However, {\it kinematics} of test particles traveling in the
new background metric is modified thanks to a new fundamental mass scale,
$\gamma$, of the model. Since the lapse-function of the new metric is
radially-dependent any incoming photon experiences (gravitational)
red/blueshift in the {\it comoving} frame, unlike in the SM. Distance scales
are modified as well due to the scale $\gamma$. The claimed $4.4\sigma$ tension
level between the locally measured Hubble constant, $H_{0}$, with SH0ES and the
corresponding value inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) could
then be significantly alleviated by an earlier-than-thought recombination.
Assuming vanishing spatial curvature, either one of the Planck 2018 (P18) or
dark energy survey (DES) yr1 data sets subject to the SH0ES prior imply that
$\gamma^{-1}$ is $O(100)$ times larger than the Hubble scale, $H_{0}^{-1}$.
Considering P18+SH0ES or P18+DES+SH0ES data set combinations, the odds against
vanishing $\gamma$ are over 1000:1 and 2000:1, respectively, and the model is
strongly favored over the SM with a deviance information criterion (DIC) gain
$\gtrsim 10$ \&amp; $\gtrsim 12$, respectively. The tension is reduced in this
model to $\sim 1.5$ \&amp; $1.3 \sigma$, respectively. We conclude that the $H_{0}$
tension may simply result from a yet unrecognized fundamental symmetry of the
gravitational interaction -- Weyl invariance. (abridged)

          <p>Sub-percent level accuracy in shear measurement is required by the Stage-IV
weak lensing surveys. One important challenge is about suppressing the shear
bias on source images of low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR$\lesssim10$).
Previously, it has been demonstrated that the shear estimators defined in the
Fourier_Quad (FQ) method can achieve sub-percent accuracy at the very faint end
(SNR$\lesssim5$) through ensemble averaging. Later, it is found that we can
approach the minimum statistical error (the Cramer-Rao Bound) by symmetrizing
the full PDF of the FQ shear estimators (the PDF_SYM approach), instead of
taking ensemble averages. Recently, with a large amount of mock galaxy images,
we are able to identify some small amount of shear biases in the PDF_SYM
approach at the faint end. The multiplicative bias goes up to
$1-2\times10^{-2}$ at SNR $\lesssim 10$, and the anisotropy of the point spread
function (PSF) causes an additive bias that can reach a few times $10^{-4}$. We
find that these biases originate from the noise-source coupling in the galaxy
power spectrum. It turns out that this problem can be largely fixed by adding
additional terms to the FQ shear estimators. The resulting multiplicative and
additive biases can be significantly suppressed to the level of $10^{-3}$ and
$10^{-5}$ respectively. These corrections substantially extend the available
SNR range for accurate shear measurement with the PDF_SYM approach.

          <p>We use EDGES measurements to determine scale and zero-level corrections to
the diffuse radio surveys by Guzm\'an et al. at $45$ MHz and Landecker &amp;
Wielebinski at $150$ MHz. We find that the Guzm\'an et al. map requires a scale
correction of $1.076 \pm 0.034$ ($2\sigma$) and a zero-level correction of
$-160 \pm 78$ K ($2\sigma$) to best-fit the EDGES data. For the Landecker &amp;
Wielebinski map, the scale correction is $1.112 \pm 0.023$ ($2\sigma$) and the
zero-level correction is $0.7 \pm 6.0$ K ($2\sigma$). The correction
uncertainties are dominated by systematic effects, of which the most
significant are uncertainty in the calibration of the EDGES receivers, antenna
pointing, and tropospheric and ionospheric effects. We propagate the correction
uncertainties to estimate the uncertainties in the corrected maps themselves
and find that the $2\sigma$ uncertainty in the map brightness temperature is in
the range $3.2-7.5\%$ for the Guzm\'an et al. map and $2.1-9.0\%$ for the
Landecker &amp; Wielebinski map, with the largest percent uncertainties occurring
at high Galactic latitudes. The corrected maps could be used to improve
existing diffuse low-frequency radio sky models, which are essential tools in
analyses of cosmological $21$ cm observations, as well as to investigate the
existence of a radio monopole excess above the cosmic microwave background and

          <p>Plenty of crucial information about our Universe is encoded in the cosmic
large-scale structure (LSS). However, the extractions of these information are
usually hindered by the nonlinearities of LSS, which can be largely alleviated
by various techniques called as the reconstruction. In realistic applications,
the efficiencies of these methods are always degraded by many limiting factors,
the quite important one of which is the shot noise induced by the finite number
density of biased matter tracers (i.e., luminous galaxies or dark matter halos)
in observations. In this work, we investigate the gains of biased tracer
reconstruction benefiting from halo mass information, which can suppress the
shot noise component and tightens the correlation between halo field and dark
matter. In conclusion, we confirm that halo masses indeed are critical
information for significantly improving the performance of biased tracer
reconstruction, demonstrating an enormous application potential for
substantially promoting the precision of cosmological measurements [especially
for baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO)] in the ambitious on-going and future
galaxy surveys.

the GWB might be far richer than expected. We present a scenario, in which
after a slow-roll (NEC-preserving) inflation with Hubble parameter $H\simeq
H_{inf1}$, the Universe goes through an NEC-violating period and then enters
subsequent slow-roll inflation with a higher $H$ ($=H_{inf2}\gg H_{inf1}$). The
resulting primordial gravitational wave spectrum is nearly flat at the cosmic

also highlighted that for the multi-stage inflation if the NEC violations
happened intermittently, we might have a Great Wall-like spectrum of the
stochastic GWB at the corresponding frequency band.

Second-Order Theory (SOT) in which the viscous properties of the fluid are
effectively described by a new set of independent variables. In particular we
study how the spin-2 modes typical of SOTs capture the simplest GW-fluid

of the primordial plasma are due to a new effectively massless self-interacting
scalar field whose state becomes a many-particles one after Reheating and for
which an effective fluid description is suitable. We numerically solve the
evolution equations and explicitly compute the current GW spectrum obtaining
two contributions: the absorption of the pGW energy due to dissipation for
small wavelengths characterized by a relative amplitude decrease of about 1 to
10 \%, and the GW production through the decay of the initial fluid

requires accurate theoretical modeling of the mildly nonlinear regime. In this
work we investigate the sensitivity of cosmological parameter measurements from
future probes of galaxy clustering to the choice of nonlinear prescription up
to $k_{\rm max}=0.3~h~\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$. In particular, we calculate the induced
parameter bias when the mildly nonlinear regime is modeled by the Halofit
fitting scheme. We find significant ($\sim5\sigma$) bias for some parameters
with a future Euclid-like survey. We also explore the contribution of different
scales to the parameter estimation for different observational setups and
cosmological scenarios, compared for the two nonlinear prescriptions of Halofit
and EFTofLSS. We include in the analysis the free parameters of the nonlinear
theory and a blind parametrization for the galaxy bias. We find that
marginalization over these nuisance parameters significantly boosts the errors
of the standard cosmological parameters. This renders the differences in the
predictions of the various nonlinear prescriptions less effective when
transferred to the parameter space. More accurate modeling of these nuisance
parameters would therefore greatly enhance the cosmological gain from the
mildly nonlinear regime.

Such ALP domain walls lead to both isotropic and anisotropic birefringence of
cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization, which reflects spatial
configuration of the domain walls at the recombination. The polarization plane
of the CMB photon coming from each domain is either not rotated at all or
rotated by a fixed angle. For domain walls following the scaling solution, the
cosmic birefringence of CMB is characterized by $2^{N}$, i.e. $N$-bit, of
information with $N = {\cal O}(10^3)$ being equal to the number of domains at
the last scattering surface, and thus the name,
$kilobyte~cosmic~birefringence$. The magnitude of the isotropic birefringence
is consistent with the recently reported value, while the anisotropic one is
determined by the structure of domains at the last scattering surface. The
detection of both signals will be a smoking-gun evidence for ALP domain walls

the early Universe and show that the stochastic gravitational wave (GW)
background produced by this system may be probed by future GW experiments
across a vast range of frequencies. The numerical simulation on the lattice
allows us to take into account non-linear backreaction effects and enables us
to accurately predict the final relic abundance of the axion or axion-like
particle (ALP) as well as its inhomogeneities, and gives a more precise
prediction of the GW spectrum. Importantly, we find that the GW spectrum has
more power at high momenta due to $2\rightarrow1$ processes. Furthermore, we
find the degree of polarization of the peak of the GW spectrum depends on the
ALP-dark photon coupling and that the polarization can be washed out or even
flipped for large values thereof. In line with recent results in the
literature, we find the ALP relic abundance may be suppressed by two orders of
magnitude and discuss possible extensions of the model that expand the viable
parameter space. Finally, we discuss the possibility to probe ultralight ALP
dark matter via spectral distortions of the CMB.

          <p>As part of an on-going effort to identify, understand and correct for
astrophysics biases in the standardization of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) for
cosmology, we have statistically classified a large sample of nearby SNeIa into
those located in predominantly younger or older environments. This
classification is based on the specific star formation rate measured within a
projected distance of 1kpc from each SN location (LsSFR). This is an important
refinement compared to using the local star formation rate directly as it
provides a normalization for relative numbers of available SN progenitors and
is more robust against extinction by dust. We find that the SNeIa in
predominantly younger environments are DY=0.163\pm0.029 mag (5.7 sigma) fainter
than those in predominantly older environments after conventional light-curve
standardization. This is the strongest standardized SN Ia brightness systematic
connected to host-galaxy environment measured to date. The well-established
step in standardized brightnesses between SNeIa in hosts with lower or higher
total stellar masses is smaller at DM=0.119\pm0.032 mag (4.5 sigma), for the
same set of SNeIa. When fit simultaneously, the environment age offset remains
very significant, with DY=0.129\pm0.032 mag (4.0 sigma), while the global
stellar mass step is reduced to DM=0.064\pm0.029 mag (2.2 sigma). Thus,
approximately 70% of the variance from the stellar mass step is due to an
underlying dependence on environment-based progenitor age. Standardization
using only the SNeIa in younger environments reduces the total dispersion from
0.142\pm0.008 mag to 0.120\pm0.010 mag. We show that as environment ages evolve
with redshift a strong bias on measurement of the dark energy equation of state
parameters can develop. Fortunately, data to measure and correct for this
effect is likely to be available for many next-generation experiments.

          <p>Intensity mapping (IM) of spectral lines has the potential to revolutionize
cosmology by increasing the total number of observed modes by several orders of
magnitude compared to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. In
this paper, we consider IM of neutral hydrogen (HI) in the redshift range $0
\lesssim z \lesssim 3$ employing a halo model approach where HI is assumed to
follow the distribution of dark matter (DM) halos. If a portion of the DM is
composed of ultralight axions then the abundance of halos is changed compared
to cold dark matter below the axion Jeans mass. With fixed total HI density,
$\Omega_{\rm HI}$, assumed to reside entirely in halos, this effect introduces
a scale-independent increase in the HI power spectrum on scales above the axion
Jeans scale, which our model predicts consistent with N-body simulations.
Lighter axions introduce a scale-dependent feature even on linear scales due to
its suppression of the matter power spectrum near the Jeans scale. We use the
Fisher matrix formalism to forecast the ability of future HI surveys to
constrain the axion fraction of DM and marginalize over astrophysical and model
uncertainties. We find that a HIRAX-like survey is a very reliable IM survey
configuration, being affected minimally by uncertainties due to non-linear
scales, while the SKA1MID configuration is the most constraining as it is
sensitive to non-linear scales. Including non-linear scales and combining a
SKA1MID-like IM survey with the Simons Observatory CMB, the benchmark "fuzzy
DM" model with $m_a = 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ can be constrained at the 10% level.
For lighter ULAs this limit improves below 1%, and allows the possibility to
test the connection between axion models and the grand unification scale across
a wide range of masses.

dark sector must have a field theory description, we obtain a unique form of
interaction strength. We show the equivalence between the fields and fluids for
the $f(R,\chi)$ model where $f$ is an arbitrary, smooth function of $R$ and
classical scalar field $\chi$, which represents dark matter. Up to first order
in perturbations, we show that the one-to-one mapping between the
\emph{classical} field theory description and the phenomenological fluid
description of interacting dark energy and dark matter exists \emph{only} for
this unique form of interaction. We then classify the interacting dark energy
models considered in the literature into two categories based on the
field-theoretic description. We introduce a novel autonomous system and its
stability analysis for the general interacting dark sector. We show that the
dark-energy dominated epoch occurs earlier than the non-interacting systems for
a specific scalar field potential and a range of coupling strengths.

          <p>The H0LiCOW collaboration inferred via gravitational lensing time delays a
Hubble constant $H_0=73.3^{+1.7}_{-1.8}$ km s$^{-1}{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, describing
deflector mass density profiles by either a power-law or stars plus standard
dark matter halos. The mass-sheet transform (MST) that leaves the lensing
observables unchanged is considered the dominant source of residual uncertainty
in $H_0$. We quantify any potential effect of the MST with flexible mass models
that are maximally degenerate with H0. Our calculation is based on a new
hierarchical approach in which the MST is only constrained by stellar
kinematics. The approach is validated on hydrodynamically simulated lenses. We
apply the method to the TDCOSMO sample of 7 lenses (6 from H0LiCOW) and measure
$H_0=74.5^{+5.6}_{-6.1}$ km s$^{-1}{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. In order to further
constrain the deflector mass profiles, we then add imaging and spectroscopy for
33 strong gravitational lenses from the SLACS sample. For 9 of the SLAC lenses
we use resolved kinematics to constrain the stellar anisotropy. From the joint
analysis of the TDCOSMO+SLACS sample, we measure $H_0=67.4^{+4.1}_{-3.2}$ km
s$^{-1}{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, assuming that the TDCOSMO and SLACS galaxies are drawn
from the same parent population. The blind H0LiCOW, TDCOSMO-only and
TDCOSMO+SLACS analyses are in mutual statistical agreement. The TDCOSMO+SLACS
analysis prefers marginally shallower mass profiles than H0LiCOW or
TDCOSMO-only. While our new analysis does not statistically invalidate the mass
profile assumptions by H0LiCOW, and thus their $H_0$ measurement relying on
those, it demonstrates the importance of understanding the mass density profile
of elliptical galaxies. The uncertainties on $H_0$ derived in this paper can be
reduced by physical or observational priors on the form of the mass profile, or
by additional data, chiefly spatially resolved kinematics of lens galaxies.

          <p>At present, cosmological observations set the most stringent bound on the
neutrino mass scale. Within the standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM), the
Planck collaboration reports $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.12\,\text{eV}$ at 95% CL. This
bound, taken at face value, excludes many neutrino mass models. However,
unstable neutrinos, with lifetimes shorter than the age of the universe
$\tau_\nu \lesssim t_U$, represent a particle physics avenue to relax this
constraint. Motivated by this fact, we present a taxonomy of neutrino decay
modes, categorizing them in terms of particle content and final decay products.
Taking into account the relevant phenomenological bounds, our analysis shows
that 2-body decaying neutrinos into BSM particles are a promising option to
relax cosmological neutrino mass bounds. We then build a simple extension of
the type I seesaw scenario by adding one sterile state $\nu_4$ and a Goldstone
boson $\phi$, in which $\nu_i \to \nu_4 \, \phi$ decays can loosen the neutrino
mass bounds up to $\sum m_\nu \sim 1\,\text{eV}$, without spoiling the light
neutrino mass generation mechanism. Remarkably, this is possible for a large
range of the right-handed neutrino masses, from the electroweak up to the GUT
scale. We successfully implement this idea in the context of minimal neutrino
mass models based on a $U(1)_{\mu-\tau}$ flavor symmetry, which are otherwise
in tension with the current bound on $\sum m_\nu$.

          <p>Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations are used to constrain
reheating to Standard Model (SM) particles after a period of inflation. As a
light spectator field, the SM Higgs boson acquires large field values from its
quantum fluctuations during inflation, gives masses to SM particles that vary
from one Hubble patch to another, and thereby produces large density
fluctuations. We consider both perturbative and resonant decay of the inflaton
to SM particles. For the case of perturbative decay from coherent oscillations
of the inflaton after high scale inflation, we find strong constraints on the
reheat temperature for the inflaton decay into heavy SM particles. For the case
of resonant particle production (preheating) to (Higgsed) SM gauge bosons, we
find temperature fluctuations larger than observed in the CMB for a range of
gauge coupling that includes those found in the SM and conclude that such
preheating cannot be the main source of reheating the Universe after inflation.

          <p>One of the most interesting candidates for dark matter are massive real
scalar particles. A well-motivated example is from a pure Yang-Mills hidden
sector, which locks up into glueballs in the early universe. The lightest
glueball states are scalar particles and can act as a form of bosonic dark
matter. If self-interactions are repulsive this can potentially lead to very
massive boson stars, where the inward gravitational force is balanced by the
repulsive self-interaction. This can also arise from elementary real scalars
with a regular potential. In the literature it has been claimed that this
allows for astrophysically significant boson stars with high compactness, which
could undergo binary mergers and generate detectable gravitational waves. Here
we show that previous analyses did not take into proper account $3 \to 2$ and
$4 \to 2$ quantum mechanical annihilation processes in the core of the star,
while other work misinterpreted the classical $3 \to 1$ process. In this work,
we compute the annihilation rates, finding that massive stars will rapidly
decay from the $3 \to 2$ or $4 \to 2$ processes (while the $3 \to 1$ process is
typically small). Using the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations, we also estimate
the binding energy of these stars, showing that even the densest stars do not
have quite enough binding energy to prevent annihilations. For such boson stars
to live for the current age of the universe and to be consistent with bounds on
dark matter scattering in galaxies, we find the following upper bound on their
mass for $O(1)$ self-interaction couplings: $M_*&lt;10^{-18}M_{sun}$ when $3 \to
2$ processes are allowed and $M_*&lt;10^{-11}M_{sun}$ when only $4 \to 2$
processes are allowed. We also estimate destabilization from parametric
resonance which can considerably constrain the phase space further.
Furthermore, such stars are required to have very small compactness to be long
lived.

first-order phase transition has been calculated to all orders of the
interactions between the bubble wall and thermal plasma, leading to a
$\gamma^2$-scaling instead of the previously estimated $\gamma^1$-scaling for
the thermal friction exerted on a fast-moving bubble wall with a Lorentz factor
$\gamma$. We propose for the first time the effective equation of motion (EOM)
for an expanding bubble wall in the presence of an arbitrary $\gamma$-scaling
friction to compute the efficiency factor from bubble collisions, which, in the
case of $\gamma^2$-scaling friction, is found to be larger than the recently
updated estimation when the bubble walls collide after starting to approach a
constant terminal velocity, leading to a slightly larger signal of the
gravitational waves background from bubble collisions due to its quadratic
dependence on the bubble collision efficiency factor, although the
$\gamma^2$-scaling friction itself has already suppressed the contribution from
bubble collisions compared to that with $\gamma^1$-scaling friction. We also
suggest a phenomenological parameterization for the out-of-equilibrium term in
the Boltzmann equation that could reproduce the recently found
$(\gamma^2-1)$-scaling of the friction term in the effective EOM of an
expanding bubble wall, which merits further study in future numerical

energies. The SM Higgs boson, as a light spectator field during inflation in
the early Universe, can acquire large field values from its quantum
fluctuations which vary among different causal (Hubble) patches. Such a space
dependence of the Higgs after the end of inflation leads to space-dependent SM
particle masses and hence variable efficiency of reheating, when the inflaton
decays to Higgsed SM particles. Inhomogeneous reheating results in (observable)
temperature anisotropies. Further, the resulting temperature anisotropy
spectrum acquires a significant non-Gaussian component, which is constrained by
$\textit{Planck}$ observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and
potentially detectable in next-generation experiments. Constraints on this
non-Gaussian signal largely exlcude the possibility of the observed temperature
anisotropies arising primarily from Higgs effects. Hence, in principle,
observational searches for non-Gaussianity in the CMB can be used to constrain
the dynamics of the Higgs boson at very high (inflationary) energies.

additional global monopole-antimonopole pairs along with normal particles,
leading to energy production {\it ab nihilo}, if the pair energy is dominated
by their negative rest masses. In a theory with unbroken local Poincar\'e
symmetry, this could lead to a divergent `decay rate' of the global monopole
configurations.
