          <p>We present a new mass function of galaxy clusters and groups using
optical/near-infrared wavelength spectroscopic and photometric data from the
Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey.
At $z\sim1$, cluster mass function studies are rare regardless of wavelength
and have never been attempted from an optical/near-infrared perspective. This
work serves as a proof of concept that $z\sim1$ cluster mass functions are
achievable without supplemental X-ray or Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) data.
Measurements of the cluster mass function provide important contraints on
cosmological parameters and are complementary to other probes. With ORELSE, a
new cluster finding technique based on Voronoi tessellation Monte-Carlo (VMC)
mapping, and rigorous purity and completeness testing, we have obtained
$\sim$240 galaxy overdensity candidates in the redshift range $0.55&lt;z&lt;1.37$ at
a mass range of $13.6&lt;\log(M/M_{\odot})&lt;14.8$. This mass range is comparable to
existing optical cluster mass function studies for the local universe. Our
candidate numbers vary based on the choice of multiple input parameters related
to detection and characterization in our cluster finding algorithm, which we
incorporated into the mass function analysis through a Monte-Carlo scheme. We
find cosmological constraints on the matter density of $\Omega_{m} =
0.250^{+0.104}_{-0.099}$ and on the amplitude of fluctuations of $\sigma_{8} =
1.150^{+0.260}_{-0.163}$. While our $\Omega_{m}$ value is close to concordance,
our $\sigma_{8}$ value is $\sim2\sigma$ higher because of the inflated observed
number densities compared to theoretical mass function models owing to how our
survey targeted overdense regions. With Euclid and several other large,
unbiased optical surveys on the horizon, VMC mapping will enable optical/NIR
cluster cosmology at redshifts much higher than what has been possible before.

          <p>SPT-CL J2106-5844 is among the most massive galaxy clusters at z&gt;1 yet
discovered. While initially used in cosmological tests to assess the
compatibility with $\Lambda$CDM cosmology of such a massive virialized object
at this redshift, more recent studies indicate SPT-CL J2106-5844 is undergoing
a major merger, and is not an isolated system with a singular, well-defined
halo. We use sensitive, high spatial resolution measurements from ALMA and ACA
of the thermal SZ effect to reconstruct the pressure distribution of the
intracluster medium in this system. These measurements are coupled with radio
observations from the EMU pilot survey, using ASKAP and the ATCA to search for
diffuse non-thermal emission. Further, to better constrain the thermodynamic
structure of the cluster, we complement our analysis with re-processed archival
$Chandra$ observations. We fit the ALMA+ACA SZ data in $uv$-space using a
Bayesian forward modelling technique. The ASKAP and ATCA data are processed and
imaged to specifically highlight any potential diffuse radio emission. In the
ALMA+ACA SZ data, we reliably identify at high significance two main gas
components associated with the mass clumps inferred from weak lensing. Our
statistical test excludes at the ~9.9$\sigma$ level the possibility of
describing the system with a single SZ component. While the components had been
more difficult to identify in the X-ray data alone, we find that the bimodal
gas distribution is supported by X-ray hardness distribution. The EMU radio
observations reveal a diffuse radio structure ~400 kpc in projected extent
along the north-west/south-east direction, indicative of strong activity from
the active galactic nucleus within the brightest cluster galaxy. Interestingly,
albeit on a smaller scale, a putative optical star-forming filamentary
structure detected in the HST image is in an excellent alignment with the radio
structure.

          <p>We present a measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$ from surface brightness
fluctuation (SBF) distances for 63 bright, mainly early-type galaxies out to
100 Mpc observed with the Wide Field Camera 3 Infrared Channel (WFC3/IR) on the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The sample is drawn from several independent HST
imaging programs that all used the WFC3/IR F110W bandpass. The distances reach
the Hubble flow, with the majority of galaxies being in the 50-80 Mpc range.
The median statistical uncertainty on individual measurements is 4%. We
construct the IR SBF Hubble diagram with these distances and constrain $H_0$
using three different treatments of the galaxy velocities. For the SBF zero
point calibration, we use both the existing tie to Cepheid variables, updated
for consistency with the latest determination of the distance to the Large
Magellanic Cloud from detached eclipsing binaries, and a new tie to the tip of
the red giant branch (TRGB) calibrated from the maser distance to NGC4258.
These two SBF calibrations are consistent with each other and with theoretical
predictions from stellar population models. From a weighted average of the
Cepheid and TRGB calibrations, we derive $H_0=73.3{\,\pm\,}0.7{\,\pm\,}2.4$
km/s/Mpc, where the error bars reflect the statistical and systematic
uncertainties. This result accords well with recent measurements of $H_0$ from
Type Ia supernovae, time delays in multiply lensed quasars, and water masers.
The systematic uncertainty could be reduced to below 2% by calibrating the SBF
method with precision TRGB distances for a statistical sample of massive
early-type galaxies out to the Virgo cluster measured with the James Webb Space
Telescope.

          <p>The analysis of weak gravitational lensing in wide-field imaging surveys is
considered to be a major cosmological probe of dark energy. Our capacity to
constrain the dark energy equation of state relies on the accurate knowledge of
the galaxy mean redshift $\langle z \rangle$. We investigate the possibility of
measuring $\langle z \rangle$ with an accuracy better than $0.002\,(1+z)$, in
ten tomographic bins spanning the redshift interval $0.2&lt;z&lt;2.2$, the
requirements for the cosmic shear analysis of Euclid. We implement a
sufficiently realistic simulation to understand the advantages,
complementarity, but also shortcoming of two standard approaches: the direct
calibration of $\langle z \rangle$ with a dedicated spectroscopic sample and
the combination of the photometric redshift probability distribution function
(zPDF) of individual galaxies. We base our study on the Horizon-AGN
hydrodynamical simulation that we analyse with a standard galaxy spectral
energy distribution template-fitting code. Such procedure produces photometric
redshifts with realistic biases, precision and failure rate. We find that the
Euclid current design for direct calibration is sufficiently robust to reach
the requirement on the mean redshift, provided that the purity level of the
spectroscopic sample is maintained at an extremely high level of $&gt;99.8\%$. The
zPDF approach could also be successful if we debias the zPDF using a
spectroscopic training sample. This approach requires deep imaging data, but is
weakly sensitive to spectroscopic redshift failures in the training sample. We
improve the debiasing method and confirm our finding by applying it to
real-world weak-lensing data sets (COSMOS and KiDS+VIKING-450).

          <p>We explore the prospect of producing primordial black holes around the solar
mass region during an early matter domination epoch. The early matter-dominated
epoch can arise when a moduli field comes to dominate the energy density of the
Universe prior to big bang nucleosynthesis. The absence of radiation pressure
during a matter-dominated epoch enhances primordial black hole formation from
the gravitational collapse of primordial density fluctuations. In particular,
we find that primordial black holes are produced in the $0.1-10~M_{\odot}$ mass
range with a favorable choice of parameters in the theory. However, they cannot
explain all of the merger events detected by the LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave
search. In such a case, primordial black holes form about $4\%$ of the total
dark matter abundance, of which $95\%$ belongs to the LIGO/Virgo consistent
mass range. The rest of the dark matter could be in the form of particles that
are produced from the decay of the moduli field during reheating.

super-horizon scales corresponding to $FWHM = 5', 10', 20', 40', 80', 160',
320', 640'$. Our main result indicates a significantly anomalous behavior of
the loops in the observed maps compared to simulations that are modeled as
isotopic and homogeneous Gaussian random fields. Specifically, we observe a
$4\sigma$ deviation between the observation and simulations in the number of
loops at $FWHM = 320'$ and $FWHM = 640'$, corresponding to super-horizon scales
of $5$ degrees and larger. In addition, we also notice a mildly significant
deviation at $2\sigma$ for all the topological descriptors for almost all the
scales analyzed. Our results show a consistency across different data releases,
and therefore, the anomalous behavior deserves a careful consideration
regarding its origin and ramifications. Disregarding the unlikely source of the
anomaly being instrumental systematics, the origin of the anomaly may be
genuinely astrophysical -- perhaps due to a yet unresolved foreground, or truly
primordial in nature. Given the nature of the topological descriptors, that
potentially encodes information of all orders, non-Gaussianities, of either
primordial or late-type nature, may be potential candidates. Alternate
possibilities include the Universe admitting a non-trivial global topology,
including effects induced by large-scale topological defects.

largest flux limited sample of X-ray clusters at $0.35 &lt; z &lt; 0.65$. It was
selected from ROSAT data in the 10,000 square degrees of overlap with BOSS,
mapping a total number of 2770 high-z galaxy clusters. We present here the full
results of the CFHT CODEX program on cluster mass measurement, including a
reanalysis of CFHTLS Wide data, with 25 individual lensing-constrained cluster
masses. We employ $lensfit$ shape measurement and perform a conservative
colour-space selection and weighting of background galaxies. Using the
combination of shape noise and an analytic covariance for intrinsic variations
of cluster profiles at fixed mass due to large scale structure, miscentring,
and variations in concentration and ellipticity, we determine the likelihood of
the observed shear signal as a function of true mass for each cluster. We
combine 25 individual cluster mass likelihoods in a Bayesian hierarchical
scheme with the inclusion of optical and X-ray selection functions to derive
constraints on the slope $\alpha$, normalization $\beta$, and scatter
$\sigma_{\ln \lambda | \mu}$ of our richness-mass scaling relation model in
log-space: $\left&lt;\ln \lambda | \mu \right&gt; = \alpha \mu + \beta$, with $\mu =
\ln (M_{200c}/M_{\mathrm{piv}})$, and $M_{\mathrm{piv}} = 10^{14.81}

0.17^{+0.13}_{-0.09}$ using CFHT richness estimates. In comparison to other

of galaxy cluster catalogs. We quantify the impact of uncertainties in HMF
parameters on cosmological constraints from cluster catalogs similar to those
from Planck, those expected from the Euclid, Roman and Rubin surveys, and from
a hypothetical larger future survey. We analyse simulated catalogs in each
case, gradually loosening priors on HMF parameters to evaluate the degradation
in cosmological constraints. While current uncertainties on HMF parameters do
not substantially impact Planck-like surveys, we find that they can
significantly degrade the cosmological constraints for a Euclid-like survey.
Consequently, the current precision on the HMF will not be sufficient for
Euclid (or Roman or Rubin) and possible larger surveys. Future experiments will
have to properly account for uncertainties in HMF parameters, and it will be
necessary to improve precision of HMF fits to avoid weakening constraints on
cosmological parameters.

its goals the characterization of these sources. We aim at characterizing the
particle-induced background of the Athena microcalorimeter, in both its low
(Soft Protons) and high (GCR) energy induced components, to assess the
instrument capability to characterize background dominated sources such as the
outskirts of clusters of galaxies. We compare two radiation environments,
namely the L1 and L2 Lagrangian points, and derive indications against the
latter. We estimate the particle-induced background level on the X-IFU
microcalorimeter with Monte Carlo simulations, before and after all the
solutions adopted to reduce its level. Concerning the GCR induced component the
background level is compliant with the mission requirement. Regarding the Soft
Protons component, the analysis does not predict dramatically different
backgrounds in the L1 and L2 orbits. However, the lack of data concerning the
L2 environment labels it as very weakly characterizable, and thus we advise
against its choice as orbit for X-ray missions. We then use these background
levels to simulate the observation of a typical galaxy cluster from its center
out to 1.2 R200 to probe the characterization capabilities of the instrument
out to the outskirts. We find that without any background reduction it is not
possible to characterize the properties of the cluster in the outer regions. We
also find no improvement of the observations when carried out during the solar
maximum with respect to the solar minimum conditions.

clustering. In this work, we explore the accuracies of spec-z and photo-z that
can be obtained in the China Space Station Optical Surveys (CSS-OS), which is a
next-generation space survey, using neural networks. The 1-dimensional
Convolutional Neural Networks (1-d CNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP, one of
the simplest forms of Artificial Neural Network) are employed to derive the
spec-z and photo-z, respectively. The mock spectral and photometric data used
for training and testing the networks are generated based on the COSMOS
catalog. The networks have been trained with noisy data by creating Gaussian
random realizations to reduce the statistical effects, resulting in similar
redshift accuracy for both high-SNR (signal to noise ratio) and low-SNR data.
The probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the predicted redshifts are
also derived via Gaussian random realizations of the testing data, and then the
best-fit redshifts and 1-sigma errors also can be obtained. We find that our
networks can provide excellent redshift estimates with accuracies ~0.001 and
0.01 on spec-z and photo-z, respectively. Compared to existing photo-z codes,
our MLP has similar accuracy but is more efficient in the training process. The
fractions of catastrophic redshifts or outliers can be dramatically suppressed
comparing to the ordinary template-fitting method. This indicates that the
neural network method is feasible and powerful for spec-z and photo-z
estimations in future cosmological surveys.

          <p>We analyze the SDSS data to classify the galaxies based on their colour using
a fuzzy set-theoretic method and quantify their environments using the local
dimension. We find that the fraction of the green galaxies does not depend on
the environment and $10\%-20\%$ of the galaxies at each environment are in the
green valley depending on the stellar mass range chosen. Approximately $10\%$
of the green galaxies at each environment host an AGN. Combining data from the
Galaxy Zoo, we find that $\sim 95\%$ of the green galaxies are spirals and
$\sim 5\%$ are ellipticals at each environment. Only $\sim 8\%$ of green
galaxies exhibit signs of interactions and mergers, $\sim 1\%$ have dominant
bulge, and $\sim 6\%$ host a bar. We show that the stellar mass distributions
for the red and green galaxies are quite similar at each environment. Our
analysis suggests that the majority of the green galaxies must curtail their
star formation using physical mechanism(s) other than interactions, mergers,
and those driven by bulge, bar and AGN activity. We speculate that these are
the massive galaxies that have grown only via smooth accretion and suppressed
the star formation primarily through mass driven quenching. Using a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we do not find any statistically significant
difference between the properties of green galaxies in different environments.
We conclude that the environmental factors play a minor role and the internal
processes play the dominant role in quenching star formation in the green

cases of the general gravitational theory with quadratic curvature and torsion
are (i) free from ghosts and tachyons and (ii) power-counting renormalisable.
We inspect the nonlinear Hamiltonian structure of the eight cases whose primary
constraints do not depend on the curvature tensor. We confirm the particle
spectra and unitarity of all these theories in the linear regime. We uncover
qualitative dynamical changes in the nonlinear regimes of all eight cases,
suggesting at least a broken gauge symmetry, and possibly the activation of
negative kinetic energy spin-parity sectors and acausal behaviour. Two of the

          <p>Radio interferometer arrays such as HERA consist of many close-packed dishes
arranged in a regular pattern, giving rise to a large number of `redundant'
baselines with the same length and orientation. Since identical baselines
should see an identical sky signal, this provides a way of finding a relative
gain/bandpass calibration without needing an explicit sky model. In reality,
there are many reasons why baselines will not be exactly identical, giving rise
to a host of effects that spoil the redundancy of the array and induce spurious
structure in the calibration solutions if not accounted for. In this paper, we
perform a wide range of simulations for a small HERA-like array to understand
how different types of non-redundancy manifest in the observed interferometric
visibilities and their resulting frequency (delay-space) power spectra. We
focus in particular on differences in the primary beam response between
antennas, including variations in the main lobe, sidelobes, ellipticity, and
orientation. We find that different types of non-redundancy impart
characteristic patterns into the redundant gain solutions, which in turn
introduce additional structure into the calibrated visibilities and therefore
the delay spectra. We show that the most severe effects of primary beam
non-redundancy are induced by the brightest sources passing through the beam,
while diffuse emission has a lesser (but non-negligible) effect. We also find
that redundant baseline groups with `outlier' antennas (where only one antenna
deviates from perfect redundancy) sustain the largest gain errors, while even
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ non-redundancies in the sidelobes seem to have a relatively
minor impact in comparison.

          <p>Weak gravitational lensing measurements based on photometry are limited by
shape noise, the variance in the unknown unlensed orientations of the source
galaxies. If the source is a disk galaxy with a well-ordered velocity field,
however, velocity field data can support simultaneous inference of the shear,
inclination, and position angle, virtually eliminating shape noise. We use the
Fisher Information Matrix formalism to forecast the precision of this method in
the idealized case of a perfectly ordered velocity field defined on an
infinitesimally thin disk. For nearly face-on targets one shear component,
$\gamma_\times$, can be constrained to $0.003\frac{90}{I_0}\frac{25}{n_{\rm
pix}}$ where $I_0$ is the S/N of the central intensity pixel and $n_{\rm pix}$
is the number of pixels across a diameter enclosing 80\% of the light. This
precision degrades with inclination angle, by a factor of three by
$i{=}50^\circ$. Uncertainty on the other shear component, $\gamma_+$, is about
1.5 (7) times larger than the $\gamma_\times$ uncertainty for targets at
$i=10^\circ$ ($50^\circ$). For arbitrary galaxy position angle on the sky,
these forecasts apply not to $\gamma_+$ and $\gamma_\times$ as defined on the
sky, but to two eigenvectors in $(\gamma_+, \gamma_\times,\mu)$ space where
$\mu$ is the magnification. We also forecast the potential of less expensive
partial observations of the velocity field such as slit spectroscopy. We
conclude by outlining some ways in which real galaxies depart from our
idealized model and thus create random or systematic uncertainties not captured
here. In particular, our forecast $\gamma_\times$ precision is currently
limited only by the data quality rather than scatter in galaxy properties
because the relevant type of scatter has yet to be measured.

          <p>In a vacuum first-order phase transition, gravitational waves are generated
from collision of bubbles of the true vacuum. The spectrum from such collisions
takes the form of a broken power law. We consider a toy model for such a phase
transition, where the dynamics of the scalar field depends on a single
parameter $\overline{\lambda}$, which controls how thin the bubble wall is at
nucleation and how close to degenerate the vacua are relative to the barrier.
We extend on our previous work by performing a series of simulations with a
range of $\overline{\lambda}$. The peak of the gravitational-wave power
spectrum varies by up to a factor of $1.3$, which is probably an unobservable
effect. We find that the ultraviolet (UV) power law in the gravitational-wave
spectrum becomes steeper as $\overline{\lambda} \rightarrow 0$, varying between
$k^{-1.4}$ and $k^{-2.2}$ for the $\overline{\lambda}$ considered. This
provides some evidence that the form of the underlying effective potential of a
vacuum first-order phase transition could be determined from the
gravitational-wave spectrum it produces.

          <p>We examine the influence of dark matter halo assembly on the evolution of a
simulated $\sim L^\star$ galaxy. Starting from a zoom-in simulation of a
star-forming galaxy evolved with the EAGLE galaxy formation model, we use the
genetic modification technique to create a pair of complementary assembly
histories: one in which the halo assembles later than in the unmodified case,
and one in which it assembles earlier. Delayed assembly leads to the galaxy
exhibiting a greater present-day star formation rate than its unmodified
counterpart, whilst in the accelerated case the galaxy quenches at $z\simeq 1$,
and becomes spheroidal. We simulate each assembly history nine times, adopting
different seeds for the random number generator used by EAGLE's stochastic
subgrid implementations of star formation and feedback. The systematic changes
driven by differences in assembly history are significantly stronger than the
random scatter induced by this stochasticity. The sensitivity of $\sim L^\star$
galaxy evolution to dark matter halo assembly follows from the close coupling
of the growth histories of the central black hole (BH) and the halo, such that
earlier assembly fosters the formation of a more massive BH, and more efficient
expulsion of circumgalactic gas. In response to this expulsion, the
circumgalactic medium reconfigures at a lower density, extending its cooling
time and thus inhibiting the replenishment of the interstellar medium. Our
results indicate that halo assembly history significantly influences the
evolution of $\sim L^\star$ central galaxies, and that the expulsion of
circumgalactic gas is a crucial step in quenching them.

          <p>(Abridged) Specific angular momentum is one of the key parameters that
control the evolution of galaxies. In this work, we derive the baryonic
specific angular momentum of disc galaxies and study its relation with the dark
matter specific angular momentum. Using a combination of high-quality HI
rotation curves and HI/near-IR surface densities, we homogeneously measure the
stellar ($j_{\rm *}$) and gas ($j_{\rm gas}$) specific angular momenta for a
large sample of local disc galaxies. This allows us to determine the baryonic
specific angular momentum ($j_{\rm bar}$) with high accuracy and across a very
wide range of masses. The $j_{\ast}-M_\ast$ relation is an unbroken power-law
from $7 \lesssim$ log($M_\ast$/$M_\odot) \lesssim 11.5$, with slope $0.54 \pm
0.02$. For the gas component, we find that the $j_{\rm gas}-M_{\rm gas}$
relation is also an unbroken power-law from $6 \lesssim$ log($M_{\rm
gas}$/$M_\odot) \lesssim 11$, with a steeper slope of $1.01 \pm 0.04$.
Regarding the baryonic relation, our data support a correlation characterized
by single power-law with slope $0.58 \pm 0.02$. Our most massive spirals and
smallest dwarfs lie along the same $j_{\rm bar}-M_{\rm bar}$ sequence. While
the relations are tight and unbroken, we find internal correlations inside
them: At fixed $M_\ast$, galaxies with larger $j_\ast$ have larger disc scale
lengths, and at fixed $M_{\rm bar}$, gas-poor galaxies have lower $j_{\rm bar}$
than expected. We estimate the retained fraction of baryonic specific angular
momentum, finding it constant across our entire mass range with a value of 0.7,
indicating that the $j_{\rm bar}$ of present-day disc galaxies is comparable to
the initial specific angular momentum of their dark matter haloes. These
results set important constraints for hydrodynamical simulations and
semi-analytical models that aim to reproduce galaxies with realistic specific
angular momenta.

halo occupation distribution (HOD) and environmental dependence of luminous
star-forming emission-line galaxies (ELGs) at $z \sim 1$. Such galaxies are key
targets for current and upcoming cosmological surveys. We select model galaxies
through cuts in colour-colour space allowing for a direct comparison with the
Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey and the Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) surveys and then compare them with galaxies
selected based on specific star-formation rate (sSFR) and stellar mass. We
demonstrate that the ELG populations are twice more likely to reside in
lower-density regions (sheets) compared with the mass-selected populations and
twice less likely to occupy the densest regions of the cosmic web (knots). We
also show that the colour-selected and sSFR-selected ELGs exhibit very similar
occupation and clustering statistics, finding that the agreement is best for
lower redshifts. In contrast with the mass-selected sample, the occupation of
haloes by a central ELG peaks at $\sim$20\%. We furthermore explore the
dependence of the HOD and the auto-correlation on environment, noticing that at
fixed halo mass, galaxies in high-density regions cluster about 10 times more
strongly than low-density ones. This result suggests that we should model
carefully the galaxy-halo relation and implement assembly bias effects into our
models (estimated at $\sim$4\% of the clustering of the DESI colour-selected
sample at $z = 0.8$). Finally, we apply a simple mock recipe to recover the
clustering on large scales ($r \gtrsim 1 \ {\rm Mpc}/h$) to within 1\% by
augmenting the HOD model with an environment dependence, demonstrating the

        <div class="mt-2 article-body">
          <p>We implement a procedure by which the parameters present in the potential of
Quartic Hilltop Inflation (QHI) are eliminated in favor of the scalar spectral
index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. By doing this it is posible to
obtain in a straightforward and simple way the equations of a previous analysis
where an analytical treatment of QHI in the large field limit is given. This
procedure also allows a more precise discussion of general properties of the
model. Also, using a constraint from the reheating epoch it is possible to find
bounds for the parameters of the model as well as for quantities of interest
such as the running of the scalar index, the reheating temperature and the
inflationary scale. Since the bounds found come from expressions given
exclusively in terms of $n_s$ and $r$ they will continue to narrow as the
measurements of the observables $n_s$ and $r$ become more sensitive.
