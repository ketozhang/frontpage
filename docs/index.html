          <p>Projection effects, whereby galaxies along the line-of-sight to a galaxy
cluster are mistakenly associated with the cluster halo, present a significant
challenge for optical cluster cosmology. We use statistically representative
spectral coverage of luminous galaxies to investigate how projection effects
impact the low-redshift limit of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redMaPPer
galaxy cluster catalog. Spectroscopic redshifts enable us to differentiate true
cluster members from false positives and determine the fraction of candidate
cluster members viewed in projection. Our main results can be summarized as
follows: first, we show that a simple double-Gaussian model can be used to
describe the distribution of line-of-sight velocities in the redMaPPer sample;
second, the incidence of projection effects is substantial, accounting for
$\sim 16$ per cent of the weighted richness for the lowest richness objects;
third, projection effects are a strong function of richness, with the
contribution in the highest richness bin being several times smaller than for
low-richness objects; fourth, our measurement has a similar amplitude to
state-of-the-art models, but finds a steeper dependence of projection effects
on richness than these models; and fifth, the slope of the observed velocity
dispersion--richness relation, corrected for projection effects, implies an
approximately linear relationship between the true, three-dimensional halo mass
and three-dimensional richness. Our results provide a robust, empirical
description of the impact of projection effects on the SDSS redMaPPer cluster
sample and exemplify the synergies between optical imaging and spectroscopic
data for studies of galaxy cluster astrophysics and cosmology.

          <p>Primordial black holes are analytically and numerically discussed based on
the extended McVittie spacetime solution. By assuming that dark matter and
radiation are the only sources of energy accreted by the forming central
object, it is found that the black-hole mass evolution depends on the initial
mass of the seed, the time in which the black hole emerges, and also on the
average peculiar velocity of dark matter particles. Constraints on the initial
conditions of the primordial black holes are derived from profiles of the
black-hole accretion mechanism and cosmological environment. A large range of
masses is compatible with our approach. In particular, masses of the order of
$10^{10}M_{\odot}$ today may also be generated from small seeds. An incubation
time for the emerging horizons is observed when the initial masses of the seeds
are close to the particle-horizon mass. It is also argued that the
McVittie-type description is consistent with the Schwarzschild solution as long
as other astrophysical processes near the central object are neglected.

          <p>Studies of intrinsic alignment effects mostly focus on the correlations
between shapes of galaxies with each other, or with the underlying density
field of the large scale structure of the universe. Lately, the correlation
between shapes of galaxies and the large-scale velocity field has been proposed
as an additional probe of the large scale structure. We use a Fisher forecast
to make a prediction for the detectability of this velocity-shape correlation
with a combination of redshifts and shapes from the 4MOST+LSST surveys, and
radial velocity reconstruction from the Simons Observatory. The signal-to-noise
ratio for the velocity-shape (dipole) correlation is 23, relative to 44 for the
galaxy density-shape (monopole) correlation and for a maximum wavenumber of
$0.2\: \mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$. Increasing signal-to-noise for higher values of the
maximum wavenumbers (respectively, 56 and 69, for a maximum wavenumber of $1\:
\mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$) indicate potential gains in the nonlinear regime.
Encouraged by these predictions, we discuss two possible applications for the
velocity-shape correlation. Measuring the velocity-shape correlation could
improve the mitigation of selection effects induced by intrinsic alignments on
galaxy clustering. We also find that velocity-shape measurements could
potentially aid in determining the scale-dependence of intrinsic alignments
when multiple shape measurements of the same galaxies are provided.

          <p>This work is a supplement on the previous research about primordial
electromagnetic fields. In this work, three important problems are discussed:
The evolution of primordial electric fields, the electric solitons in plasma
before decoupling and their influences on the power spectra of cosmic microwave
background. Detailed computations show that the primordial electric fields
dissipate by Landau damping effect on both large scale and small scale and
there is no impact on the spectrum. While, before recombination, there exist
solitary waves stably propagating in plasma whose speed is significantly slower
than that of baryonic acoustic oscillations which works only at extremely
scale. On the other hand, the amplitude of solitons is significantly small, so
there merely exist the messages about such electric solitary waves on the
spectrum. In a word, as relevant monographs on cosmology, neglecting the
electromagnetic fields (electric fields at least) is a reasonable treatment on
the calculations of cosmic microwave background. However, these electric
solitary waves have preserved after the recombination, which may be the origin
of initial electromagnetic fields to promote generation and evolution of
galaxies.

dark energy. These models are motivated by the possible application of
holographic principle to the dark energy problem. We study the one parameter Li
holographic dark energy and the two parameter Barrow holographic dark energy
models using configuration entropy of the matter distribution in the Universe.
The configuration entropy rate exhibits a distinct minimum at a specific scale
factor that corresponds to the epoch, beyond which the dark energy takes a
driving role in the accelerated expansion of the Universe. We find that the
location of the minimum and magnitude of the entropy rate at the minimum are
sensitive to the parameters of the models. We find the best fit relations
between these quantities and the parameters of each model. We propose that
these relations can be used to constrain the parameters of the holographic dark
energy models from the future measurements of the configuration entropy at
multiple redshifts. Further, the Barrow holographic dark energy model is based
on Barrow entropy which modifies the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, to
capture the deformation of the black-hole surface due to quantum gravitational
effects. We find that the location and amplitude of the minimum of the
configuration entropy rate is strongly sensitive to the deformation exponent
$\Delta$ in the Barrow model. Our study suggests that signatures of the quantum
gravitational effects on the future event horizon may be detected from the
study of the configuration entropy of the matter distribution on large-scales.

distinct dust populations at separate radii ($\sim$40 light days and $\sim$90
light days), with temperatures of $\sim$1500--2500 K and $\sim$900--1000 K,
consistent with the expected properties of sublimating graphite and silicate
dust grains. The torus inner edge defined by the hottest dust remains at
roughly the same radius independent of the AGN optical luminosity over $\sim$
25 years. The emission by hot dust warmed directly by the optical/UV AGN output
has increased gradually by $\sim$ 4%/year, indicating a possibly growing torus.
A third dust component at $\sim$700 K does not seem to participate directly in
the IR reverberation behavior and its emission may originate deep in the
circumnuclear torus. We find a reverberation signal at $\sim10~\mu$m with an
inferred radius for the warm dust of $\sim$2.6 pc. The lack of variability at
20--40~$\mu$m indicates the far-IR emission comes from even more extended
regions. The torus properties revealed by dust reverberation analysis are
inconsistent with predictions from pure clumpy torus models. Instead, the NGC
4151 torus appears to be flared, allowing direct dust heating by the nucleus
over radial distances of $\sim$0.03 to $\gtrsim$3 pc. We integrate our results

candidates for dark matter. Due to its excellent success in removing many
astrophysical problems, particularly in small scale structure, studying this
model has taken on added significance. In this paper, we focus on the results
of two previously performed simulations of cluster size halos with
self-interacting dark matter and introduce a new function for the density
profile of galaxy clusters, which can perfectly describe the result of these
simulations. This density profile helps to find a velocity dispersion profile
and also a relation between cluster mass and concentration parameter. Using
these relations, we investigate two scaling relations of galaxy clusters,
namely mass-velocity dispersion and mass-temperature relations. As an important
discrepancy appears in the calculated masses for given temperatures regarding
the obtained mass-temperature relation, we propose a new interacting model and
show that this model can completely solve the problem. This model is a
combination of self-interacting dark matter idea with another model of the dark
sector in which dark matter particle mass is determined according to its
interaction with dark energy. We find that in this super interacting dark
sector (SIDS) model, the virial ratio changes to have higher values than

the constants of this interacting model with the value of cross-section per

we demonstrate that the lensing results are sensitive to the true power

the method recovers the true lensing power spectrum. The method also recovers
the matter power spectrum across the sky, but as currently implemented, it

our method provides physically plausible inference of the dark matter

perturbations respectively. We verify the consistency of the datasets used in
this work in the GPT framework and confirm that the individual tensions do not
require conflicting transitions. We find that the joint datasets prefer a
recent transition at $z_{\rm t}\approx 0.9$ in the background and perturbed
Einstein equations, driven mainly by the local Hubble measurement. This
transition relaxes all the tensions considered in this work.

          <p>We present a Bayesian calibration algorithm for CMB observations as
implemented within the global end-to-end BeyondPlanck (BP) framework, and apply
this to the Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) data. Following the most
recent Planck analysis, we decompose the full time-dependent gain into a sum of
three orthogonal components: One absolute calibration term, common to all
detectors; one time-independent term that can vary between detectors; and one
time-dependent component that is allowed to vary between one-hour pointing
periods. Each term is then sampled conditionally on all other parameters in the
global signal model through Gibbs sampling. The absolute calibration is sampled
using only the orbital dipole as a reference source, while the two relative
gain components are sampled using the full sky signal, including the orbital
and Solar CMB dipoles, CMB fluctuations, and foreground contributions. We
discuss various aspects of the data that influence gain estimation, including
the dipole/polarization quadrupole degeneracy and anomalous jumps in the
instrumental gain. Comparing our solution to previous pipelines, we find good
agreement in general, with relative deviations of -0.84% (-0.67%) for 30 GHz,
-0.14% (0.02%) for 44 GHz and -0.69% (-0.08%) for 70 GHz, compared to Planck
2018 (NPIPE). The deviations we find are within expected error bounds, and we
attribute them to differences in data usage and general approach between the
pipelines. In particular, the BP calibration is performed globally, resulting
in better inter-frequency consistency. Additionally, WMAP observations are used
actively in the BP analysis, which breaks degeneracies in the Planck data set
and results in better agreement with WMAP. Although our presentation and
algorithm are currently oriented toward LFI processing, the procedure is fully
generalizable to other experiments.

measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization $B$-modes with
"delensing,'' whereby the uncertainty on $r$ contributed by the sample variance
of the gravitational lensing $B$-modes is reduced by cross-correlating against
a lensing $B$-mode template. This template is constructed by combining an
estimate of the polarized CMB with a tracer of the projected large-scale

infrared background derived from Planck satellite data, while the polarized CMB
map comes from a combination of South Pole Telescope, BICEP/Keck, and Planck

lensing template and apply it to the BICEP/Keck data set collected through 2014

From simulations, we find that the uncertainty on $r$ is reduced by $\sim10\%$,
from $\sigma(r)$= 0.024 to 0.022, which can be compared with a $\sim26\%$

          <p>The significance of the Ly$\alpha$ emission line as a probe of the
high-redshift Universe has long been established. Originating mainly in the
vicinity of young, massive stars and in association with accretion of large
bulks of matter, it is ideal for detecting young galaxies, the fundamental
building blocks of our Universe. Since many different processes shape the
spectrum and the spatial distribution of the Ly$\alpha$ photons in various
ways, a multitude of physical properties of galaxies can be unveiled. However,
this also makes the interpretation of Ly$\alpha$ observations notoriously
difficult. Because Ly$\alpha$ is a resonant line, it scatters on neutral
hydrogen, having its path length from the source to our telescopes vastly
increased, and taking it through regions of unknown physical conditions. In
this work, a numerical code capable of calculating realistically the radiative
transfer of Ly$\alpha$ is presented. The code is capable of performing the
radiative transfer in an arbitrary and adaptively refined distribution of
Ly$\alpha$ source emission, temperature and velocity field of the interstellar
and intergalactic medium, as well as density of neutral and ionized hydrogen,
and, particularly important, dust. Accordingly, it is applied to galaxies
simulated at high resolution, yielding a number of novel and interesting
results, most notably the escape fractions of Ly$\alpha$ photons, the effect of
dust on the line profile, and the impact of the transfer through the
intergalactic medium. Furthermore, the remarkable detection of Ly$\alpha$
emission from a so-called "damped Ly$\alpha$ absorber" -- a special type of
objects thought to be the progenitor of present-day's galaxies -- is presented,
and the potential of the code for interpreting observations is demonstrated.

          <p>We present a detailed investigation of the Rastall gravity extension of the
standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We review the model for two simultaneous
modifications of different nature in the Friedmann equation due to the Rastall
gravity: the new contributions of the material (actual) sources (considered as
effective source) and the altered evolution of the material sources. We discuss
the role/behavior of these modifications with regard to some low redshift
tensions, including the so-called $H_0$ tension, prevailing within the standard
$\Lambda$CDM. We constrain the model at the level of linear perturbations, and
obtain the first constraints through a robust and accurate analysis using the
latest full Planck CMB data, with and without including BAO data. We find that
the Rastall parameter $\epsilon$ (null for general relativity) is consistent
with zero at 68\% CL (with a tendency towards positive values, $-0.0001 &lt;
\epsilon &lt; 0.0007$ (CMB+BAO) at 68\% CL), which in turn implies no significant
statistical evidence for deviation from general relativity, and also a
precision of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ for the coefficient $-1/2$ of the term
$g_{\mu\nu}R$ in the Einstein field equations of general relativity
(guaranteeing the local energy-momentum conservation). We explore the
consequences led by the Rastall gravity on the cosmological parameters in the
light of the observational analyses. It turns out that the effective source
dynamically screens the usual vacuum energy at high redshifts, but this
mechanism barely works due to the opposition by the altered evolution of CDM.
Consequently, two simultaneous modifications of different nature in the
Friedmann equation act against each other, and do not help to considerably
relax the so-called low redshift tensions. Our results may offer a guide for
the research community that studies the Rastall gravity in various aspects of
gravitation and cosmology.

          <p>Fast and accurate simulations of the non-linear evolution of the cosmic
density field are a major component of many cosmological analyses, but the
computational time and storage required to run them can be exceedingly large.
For this reason, we use generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn a
compressed representation of the 3D matter density field that is fast and easy
to sample, and for the first time show that GANs are capable of generating
samples at the level of accuracy of other conventional methods. Using
sub-volumes from a suite of GADGET-2 N-body simulations, we demonstrate that a
deep-convolutional GAN can generate samples that capture both large- and
small-scale features of the matter density field, as validated through a
variety of n-point statistics. The use of a data scaling that preserves
high-density features and a heavy-tailed latent space prior allow us to obtain
state of the art results for fast 3D cosmic web generation. In particular, the
mean power spectra from generated samples agree to within 5% up to k=3 and
within 10% for k&lt;5 when compared with N-body simulations, and similar accuracy
is obtained for a variety of bispectra. By modeling the latent space with a
heavy-tailed prior rather than a standard Gaussian, we better capture sample
variance in the high-density voxel PDF and reduce errors in power spectrum and
bispectrum covariance on all scales. Furthermore, we show that a conditional
GAN can smoothly interpolate between samples conditioned on redshift. Deep
generative models, such as the ones described in this work, provide great

describing the spectral shape of the signal, (iii) accounts for galactic
confusion noise from compact binaries, and (iv) exhibits the dependence of the
expected sensitivity on the collected amount of data. An important outcome of
this analysis is that, for the considered set of models, galactic confusion

simulation in the light-cone volume (Horizon Run 4), sky-trimmed and including
the effects of foreground contamination, its removal and instrument noise. We
first validate how the foreground residual affects the recovered 21-cm signal
by putting different levels of foreground contamination into the 21-cm maps. We
find that the contamination cannot be ignored in the angular autocorrelation
power spectra of HI even when it is small, but has no influence on the accuracy
of the angular cross-power spectra between HI and galaxies. In the
foreground-cleaned map case, as information is lost in the cleaning procedure,
there is also a bias in the cross-correlation power spectrum. However, we found
that the bias from the cross-correlation power spectrum is scale-independent,
which is easily parameterized as part of the model, while the offset in the HI
autocorrelation power spectrum is non-linear. In particular, we tested that the
cross-correlation power also benefits from the cancellation of the bias in the
power spectrum measurement that is induced by the instrument noise, which
changes the shape of the autocorrelation power spectra but leaves the
cross-correlation power unaffected. We then modelled the angular
cross-correlation power spectra to fit the baryon acoustic oscillation feature
in the broad-band shape of the angular cross-correlation power spectrum,
including contamination from the residual foreground and the effect of
instrument noise. We forecast a constraint on the angular diameter distance
$D_\mathrm{A}$ for the Tianlai Pathfinder redshift $0.775&lt;z&lt;1.03$, giving a

          <p>Recently, an anomalous excess was found in the electronic recoil data
collected at the XENON1T experiment. The excess may be explained by an
axion-like particle (ALP) with mass of a few keV and a coupling to electron of
$g_{ae} \sim 10^{-13}$, if the ALP constitutes all or some fraction of local
dark matter (DM). In order to satisfy the X-ray constraint, the ALP coupling to
photons must be significantly suppressed compared to that to electrons. This
strongly suggests that the ALP has no anomalous couplings to photons, i.e.,
there is no U(1)$_{\rm PQ}$-U(1)$_{\rm em}$-U(1)$_{\rm em}$ anomaly. We show
that such anomaly-free ALP DM predicts an X-ray line signal with a definite
strength through the operator arising from threshold corrections, and compare
it with the projected sensitivity of the ATHENA X-ray observatory. The
abundance of ALP DM can be explained by the misalignment mechanism, or by
thermal production if it constitutes a part of DM. In particular, we find that
the anomalous excess reported by the XENON1T experiment as well as the stellar
cooling anomalies from white dwarfs and red giants can be explained
simultaneously better when the ALP constitutes about 10\% of DM. As concrete
models, we revisit the leptophilic anomaly-free ALP DM considered in
[Phys.Lett.B 734 (2014) 178-182] as well as an ALP model based on a two Higgs

          <p>We derive the bispectrum's squeezed limit of primordial curvature
perturbations in canonical single field inflation valid to all orders in
slow-roll parameters. Our derivation relies exclusively on the diffeomorphism
invariance of canonical single field inflation, and does not require taking
into consideration de Sitter isometries or shift symmetries of the ultraviolet
theory in which inflation is build upon. Our result consists in the standard
Maldacena's consistency relation (proportional to the spectral index of the
power spectrum) plus additional terms containing time derivatives of the power
spectrum. An important consequence of our result is the conclusion that a
non-attractor phase (e.g. ultra slow roll phase) cannot generate large local
non-Gaussianity at the end of inflation. This is because as soon as the
non-attractor phase finishes, the amplitudes of super-horizon modes stop
growing, and one recovers Maldacena's consistency relation. Thus, we claim that
a robust prediction from canonical single field inflation (attractor or
non-attractor) is that the observable local primordial non-Gaussianity vanishes
exactly.

        <strong>Gravitational wave lensing beyond general relativity: birefringence, echoes and shadows. (arXiv:2009.12187v2 [gr-qc] UPDATED)</strong>

          <p>Gravitational waves (GW), as light, are gravitationally lensed by intervening
matter, deflecting their trajectories, delaying their arrival and occasionally
producing multiple images. In theories beyond general relativity (GR), new
gravitational degrees of freedom add an extra layer of complexity and richness
to GW lensing. We develop a formalism to compute GW propagation beyond GR over
general space-times, including kinetic interactions with new fields. Our
framework relies on identifying the dynamical propagation eigenstates (linear
combinations of the metric and additional fields) at leading order in a
short-wave expansion. We determine these eigenstates and the conditions under
which they acquire a different propagation speed around a lens. Differences in
speed between eigenstates cause birefringence phenomena, including time delays
between the metric polarizations (orthogonal superpositions of $h_+,h_\times$)
observable without an electromagnetic counterpart. In particular, GW echoes are
produced when the accumulated delay is larger than the signal's duration, while
shorter time delays produce a scrambling of the wave-form. We also describe the
formation of GW shadows as non-propagating metric components are sourced by the
background of the additional fields around the lens. As an example, we apply
our methodology to quartic Horndeski theories with Vainshtein screening and
show that birefringence effects probe a region of the parameter space
complementary to the constraints from the multi-messenger event GW170817. In
the future, identified strongly lensed GWs and binary black holes merging near
dense environments, such as active galactic nuclei, will fulfill the potential
of these novel tests of gravity.

        <strong>Primordial Non-Gaussianity from Biased Tracers: Likelihood Analysis of Real-Space Power Spectrum and Bispectrum. (arXiv:2010.14523v2 [astro-ph.CO] UPDATED)</strong>

          <p>Upcoming galaxy redshift surveys promise to significantly improve current
limits on primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) through measurements of 2- and
3-point correlation functions in Fourier space. However, realizing the full
potential of this dataset is contingent upon having both accurate theoretical
models and optimized analysis methods. Focusing on the local model of PNG,
parameterized by $f_{\rm NL}$, we perform a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain analysis
to confront perturbation theory predictions of the halo power spectrum and
bispectrum in real space against a suite of N-body simulations. We model the
halo bispectrum at tree-level, including all contributions linear and quadratic
in $f_{\rm NL}$, and the halo power spectrum at 1-loop, including tree-level
terms up to quadratic order in $f_{\rm NL}$ and all loops induced by local PNG
linear in $f_{\rm NL}$. Keeping the cosmological parameters fixed, we examine
the effect of informative priors on the linear non-Gaussian bias parameter on
the statistical inference of $f_{\rm NL}$. A conservative analysisof the
combined power spectrum and bispectrum, in which only loose priors are imposed
and all parameters are marginalized over, can improve the constraint on $f_{\rm
NL}$ by more than a factor of 5 relative to the power spectrum-only
measurement. Imposing a strong prior on $b_\phi$, or assuming bias relations
for both $b_\phi$ and $b_{\phi\delta}$ (motivated by a universal mass function
assumption), improves the constraints further by a factor of few. In this case,
however, we find a significant systematic shift in the inferred value of
$f_{\rm NL}$ if the same range of wavenumber is used. Likewise, a Poisson noise
assumption can lead to significant systematics, and it is thus essential to
leave all the stochastic amplitudes free.

        <strong>Galaxy spin direction distribution in HST and SDSS show similar large-scale asymmetry. (arXiv:2011.03723v2 [astro-ph.CO] UPDATED)</strong>

          <p>Several recent observations using large datasets of galaxies showed
non-random distribution of the spin directions of spiral galaxies, even when
the galaxies are too far from each other to have gravitational interaction.
Here, a dataset of $\sim8.7\cdot10^3$ spiral galaxies imaged by Hubble Space
Telescope is used to test and profile a possible asymmetry between galaxy spin
directions. The asymmetry between galaxies with opposite spin directions is
compared to the asymmetry of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The
two datasets contain different galaxies at different redshift ranges, and each
dataset was annotated using a different annotation method. The results show
that both datasets show a similar asymmetry in the COSMOS field, which is
covered by both telescopes. Fitting the asymmetry of the galaxies to cosine
dependence shows a dipole axis with probabilities of $\sim2.8\sigma$ and
$\sim7.38\sigma$ in HST and SDSS, respectively. The most likely dipole axis
identified in the HST galaxies is at $(\alpha=78^o,\delta=47^o)$, and is well
within the $1\sigma$ error range compared to the location of the most likely
dipole axis in the SDSS galaxies with $z&gt;0.15$, identified at
$(\alpha=71^o,\delta=61^o)$.
