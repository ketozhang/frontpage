          <p>While the evolution of linear initial conditions present in the early
universe into extended halos of dark matter at late times can be computed using
cosmological simulations, a theoretical understanding of this complex process
remains elusive. Here, we build a deep learning framework to learn this
non-linear relationship, and develop techniques to physically interpret the
learnt mapping. A three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) is
trained to predict the mass of dark matter halos from the initial conditions.
We find no change in the predictive accuracy of the model if we retrain the
model removing anisotropic information from the inputs. This suggests that the
features learnt by the CNN are equivalent to spherical averages over the
initial conditions. Our results indicate that interpretable deep learning
frameworks can provide a powerful tool for extracting insight into cosmological
structure formation.

absorption system at z=6.84, seen in the spectrum of the z=7.54 background
quasar ULAS J134208.10+092838.61. Singly ionized C, Si, Fe, Mg, and Al
measurements are consistent with a warm neutral medium that is metal-poor but
not chemically pristine. Firm non-detections of C IV and Si IV imply that any
warm ionized phase of the IGM or CGM has not yet been enriched past the
ultra-metal-poor regime (&lt;0.001Z_{solar}), unlike lower redshift DLAs where
these lines are nearly ubiquitous. Relative abundances of the heavy elements
794 Myr after the Big Bang resemble those of metal-poor damped Lyman Alpha
systems at intermediate redshift and Milky Way halo stars, and show no evidence
of enhanced [alpha/Fe], [C/Fe] or other signatures of yields dominated by
massive stars. A detection of the CII* fine structure line reveals local
sources of excitation from heating, beyond the level of photo-excitation
supplied by the CMB. We estimate the total and [CII] cooling rates, balancing
against ISM heating sources to develop an heuristic two-phase model of the
neutral medium. The implied heating requires a surface density of star
formation slightly exceeding that of the Milky Way but not at the level of a
strong starburst. For a typical (assumed) NHI=10^{20.6}, an abundance of
[Fe/H]=-2.2 matches the columns of species in the neutral phase. To remain
undetected in C IV, a warm ionized phase would either need much lower
[C/H]&lt;-4.2 over an absorption path of 1 kpc, or else a very small absorption
path (a few pc). While still speculative, these results suggest a significant
reduction in heavy element enrichment outside of neutral star forming regions
of the ISM, as would be expected in early stages of galactic chemical
evolution.

          <p>We demonstrate the impact on forecasted neutrino mass constraints of
extending galaxy clustering and CMB lensing predictions from linear to
next-to-leading-order power spectra. The redshift-space 1-loop power spectrum
model we adopt requires an additional four free bias parameters, a velocity
bias parameter and two new stochastic parameters. These additional nuisance
parameters appreciably weaken the constraints on $M_\nu$. CMB lensing plays a
significant role in helping to alleviate these degeneracies and tighten the
final constraints. The constraint on the optical depth to reionisation $\tau$
has a strong effect on the constraint on $M_\nu$, but only when CMB lensing is
included in the analysis to keep the degeneracies with the nuisance parameters
under control. We also extract constraints when 1) using the BAO signature only
as a distance probe, and 2) isolating the scale-dependence of the power
spectrum, which, as shown in previous work, provides a cosmology-independent
probe of $M_\nu$. All constraints except the latter remain strongly sensitive
to the assumption of a flat $\Lambda$CDM universe. We perform an analysis of
the magnitude of the shift introduced in the inferred $M_\nu$ value when
neglecting nonlinear corrections, and show that, for a Euclid-like survey, this
shift becomes roughly equal to the 1$\sigma$ constraint itself even with a
conservative cut-off scale of $k_{max} = 0.1~h~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We also perform
a calculation of the appropriate expected bias in neutrino mass caused by not
including the next, 2-loop order and expect a shift of only about 20% of the
1$\sigma$ error for $k_{max}=0.2~h~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ in a Euclid-like survey.

a peak, the amplitude of primordial curvature perturbations can be enhanced by
seven-orders of magnitude at small scales while keeping to be consistent with
observations at large scales. The peak function and inflationary potential are
not restricted in this mechanism. We use the Higgs model and T-model as
examples to show how abundant primordial black hole dark matter with different

curvature perturbations and the energy density of the induced secondary

primordial black holes with the mass around $10^{-14}-10^{-12} M_{\odot}$

the induced secondary gravitational waves accompanied with the production of

          <p>The presence of an invisible substructure has previously been detected in the
gravitational lens galaxy SDSSJ0946+1006 through its perturbation of the lensed
images. Using flexible models for the main halo and the subhalo perturbation to
fit the lensed images, we demonstrate that the subhalo has an extraordinarily
high central density and steep density slope. The inferred concentration for
the subhalo is well above the expected scatter in concentrations for
$\Lambda$CDM halos of similar mass. We robustly infer the subhalo's projected
mass within 1 kpc to be $\sim 2$-$3.7\times 10^9$M$_\odot$ at $&gt;$95% CL for all
our lens models, while the average slope of the subhalo's projected density
profile over the radial range 0.75-1.25 kpc is constrained to be steeper than
isothermal ($\gamma_{2D} \lesssim -1$). By modeling the subhalo light directly,
we infer a conservative upper bound on its luminosity $L_V &lt; 1.2\times
10^8L_\odot$ at 95% CL, which shows that the perturber is dark matter
dominated. To compare to $\Lambda$CDM expectations, we analyze subhalos within
analogues of lensing galaxies in the Illustris TNG100-1 simulation over many
lines of sight, and find hundreds of subhalos that achieve a projected mass
within 1 kpc of $\gtrsim 2\times10^9M_\odot$. However, less than 1% of the mock
observations yield a log-slope steep enough to be consistent with our lensing
models, and they $all$ have stellar masses in excess of that allowed by
observations by about an order of magnitude or more. We conclude that the
presence of such a dark, highly concentrated subhalo is unexpected in a
$\Lambda$CDM universe. Finally, we show that this tension with CDM is not
significantly reduced if the perturber is assumed to be a line-of-sight
structure, rather than a subhalo.

          <p>We demonstrate that the perturbations of strongly lensed images by low-mass
dark matter subhalos are significantly impacted by the concentration of the
perturbing subhalo. For subhalo concentrations expected in $\Lambda$CDM,
significant constraints on the concentration can be obtained at HST resolution
for subhalos with masses larger than about $10^{10}M_\odot$. Constraints are
also possible for lower mass subhalos, if their concentrations are higher than
the expected scatter in CDM. We also find that the concentration of lower mass
perturbers down to $\sim 10^8M_\odot$ can be well-constrained with a resolution
of $\sim 0.01''$, which is achievable with long-baseline interferometry.
Subhalo concentration also plays a critical role in the detectability of a
perturbation, such that only high concentration perturbers with mass $\lesssim
10^9M_\odot$ are likely to be detected at HST resolution. If scatter in the
$\Lambda$CDM mass-concentration relation is not accounted for during lens
modeling, the inferred subhalo mass can be biased by up to a factor of 3(6) for
subhalos of mass $10^9 M_\odot$($10^{10} M_\odot$); this bias can be eliminated
if one varies both mass and concentration during lens fitting. Alternatively,
one may robustly infer the projected mass within the subhalo's perturbation
radius, defined by its distance to the critical curve of the lens being
perturbed. With a sufficient number of detections, these strategies will make
it possible to constrain the halo mass-concentration relation at low masses in
addition to the mass function, offering a probe of dark matter physics as well
as the small-scale primordial power spectrum.

analysis of the large-scale structure of Universe, in particular, in deep
fields. We study the large-scale structure of the Universe along the line of

518,404 high quality photometric redshifts of galaxies selected in the optical

          <p>Upcoming and future neutral hydrogen Intensity Mapping surveys offer a great
opportunity to constrain cosmology in the post-reionization Universe, provided
a good accuracy is achieved in the separation between the strong foregrounds
and the cosmological signal. Cleaning methods rely on the frequency smoothness
of the foregrounds and are often applied under the assumption of a simplistic
Gaussian primary beam. In this work, we test the cleaning in the presence of a
realistic primary beam model with a non trivial frequency dependence. We focus
on the Square Kilometre Array precursor MeerKAT telescope and simulate a
single-dish wide area survey. We consider the main foreground components,
including an accurate full sky point source catalogue. We find that the
coupling between beam sidelobes and the foreground structure can complicate the
cleaning. However, when the beam frequency dependence is smooth, we show that
the cleaning is only problematic if the far sidelobes are unexpectedly large.
Even in that case, a proper reconstruction is possible if the strongest point
sources are removed and the cleaning is more aggressive. We then consider a
non-trivial frequency dependence: a sinusoidal type feature in the beam width
that is present in the MeerKAT beam and is expected in most dishes, including
SKA1-MID. Such a feature, coupling with the foreground emission, biases the
reconstruction of the signal across frequency, potentially impacting the
cosmological analysis. Interestingly, such contamination is present at a lower
level even when no point sources are included and the beam is Gaussian, showing
that this frequency ripple can be problematic even within the main lobe. We
show that this effect is constrained to a narrow region in $k_\parallel$ space
and can be reduced if the maps are carefully re-smoothed to a common lower
resolution.

          <p>Relaxing the conventional assumption of a minimal coupling between the dark
matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) fields introduces significant changes in the
predicted evolution of the Universe. Therefore, testing such a possibility
constitutes an essential task not only for cosmology but also for fundamental
physics. In a previous communication [Phys. Rev. D99, 043521, 2019], we
proposed a new null test for the $\Lambda$CDM model based on the time
dependence of the ratio between the DM and DE energy densities which is also
able to detect potential signatures of interaction between the dark components.
In this work, we extend that analysis avoiding the $ \Lambda$CDM assumption and
reconstruct the interaction in the dark sector in a fully model-independent way
using data from type Ia supernovae, cosmic chronometers and baryonic acoustic
oscillations. According to our analysis, the $\Lambda$CDM model is consistent
with our model-independent approach at least at $3\sigma$ CL over the entire
range of redshift studied. On the other hand, our analysis shows that the
current background data do not allow us to rule out the existence of an
interaction in the dark sector. Finally, we present a forecast for
next-generation LSS surveys. In particular, we show that Euclid and SKA will be
able to distinguish interacting models with about 4\% of precision at $z\approx
1$.

with a nonthermal photon spectrum derived by solving the Boltzmann equation
iteratively. The exact spectrum is much different than that based on an
often-used analytical bended power-law spectrum. With the newest observational
limit on the $^3$He abundance in Galactic H II regions, the updated $^3$He
constraints on PBH mass spectrum in the horizon mass range $10^{12} - 10^{13}$
g are derived. Our results show that the previous monochromatic limits are
significantly stronger by almost two orders of magnitude, and the possible
reasons of this discrepancy are explained. We also find that the $^3$He
constraints on critical mass function are one order of magnitude severer than
the monochromatic ones, even though the fraction of PBHs in the low-mass tail
region is relatively small. The $^6$Li elemental abundance is also enhanced
significantly for the critical mass function. More precise measurement of
$^6$Li abundance is highly desirable to provide a promising constraint on PBHs
in the future.

          <p>We examine the evolution of peculiar velocities of arrays of inhomogeneous
cosmic structures in a $\Lambda$CDM background identified as a comoving CMB
frame. These arrays are constructed by smoothly matching to this cosmological
background regions of Szekeres-II models with their imperfect fluid
energy--momentum tensor reinterpreted as non-comoving dust, keeping only first

compatible with values reported in the literature. By evaluating and comparing
the Hubble flows for the comoving and non-comoving frames we obtain a

overly simplistic system, other linear two-state systems can be mapped onto the

This "quantum kinetic equilibrium" attains as the quantum development of phase

update of abundance predictions for light elements produced during the big-bang

in its early days, BBN constraining power mostly rests on deuterium abundance.
We point out a new $\simeq1.8\sigma$-tension on the baryonic density, or
equivalently on the D/H abundance, between the value inferred on one hand from
the analysis of the primordial abundances of light elements and, on the other
hand, from the combination of CMB and baryonic oscillation data. This draws the
attention on this sector of the theory and gives us the opportunity to
reevaluate the status of BBN in the context of precision cosmology. Finally,

          <p>We use cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations from the
NIHAO project to investigate the response of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes to
baryonic processes. Previous work has shown that the halo response is primarily
a function of the ratio between galaxy stellar mass and total virial mass, and
the density threshold above which gas is eligible to form stars, $n [{\rm
cm}^{-3}]$. At low $n$ all simulations in the literature agree that dwarf
galaxy haloes are cuspy, but at high $n\ge 100$ there is no consensus. We trace
halo contraction in dwarf galaxies with $n\ge 100$ reported in some previous
simulations to insufficient spatial resolution. Provided the adopted star
formation threshold is appropriate for the resolution of the simulation, we
show that the halo response is remarkably stable for $n\ge 5$, up to the
highest star formation threshold that we test, $n=500$. This free parameter can
be calibrated using the observed clustering of young stars. Simulations with
low thresholds $n\le 1$ predict clustering that is too weak, while simulations
with high star formation thresholds $n\ge 5$, are consistent with the observed
clustering. Finally, we test the CDM predictions against the circular
velocities of nearby dwarf galaxies. Low thresholds predict velocities that are
too high, while simulations with $n\sim 10$ provide a good match to the
observations. We thus conclude that the CDM model provides a good description
of the structure of galaxies on kpc scales provided the effects of baryons are
properly captured.

          <p>A Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) halo consists of a soliton core close to the center
and an NFW-like density profile in the outer region. Previous investigations
found that the soliton core exhibits temporal oscillations and random walk
excursions around the halo center. Analyzing a set of numerical simulations, we
show that both phenomena can be understood as the results of wave interference
-- a suitable superposition of the ground (solitonic) state and excited states
in a fixed potential suffices to account for the main features of these
phenomena. Such an eigenmode analysis can shed light on the evolution of a
satellite halo undergoing tidal disruption. As the outer halo is stripped away,
reducing the amplitudes of the excited states, the ground state evolves
adiabatically. This suggests diminished soliton oscillations and random walk
excursions, an effect to consider in deducing constraints from stellar heating.

          <p>Recently the thermal friction on an expanding bubble from the cosmic
first-order phase transition has been calculated to all orders of the
interactions between the bubble wall and thermal plasma, leading to a
$\gamma^2$-scaling instead of the previously estimated $\gamma^1$-scaling for
the thermal friction exerted on a fast-moving bubble wall with a Lorentz factor
$\gamma$. We propose for the first time the effective equation of motion (EOM)
for an expanding bubble wall in the presence of an arbitrary $\gamma$-scaling
friction to compute the efficiency factor from bubble collisions, which, in the
case of $\gamma^2$-scaling friction, is found to be larger than the recently
updated estimation when the bubble walls collide after starting to approach a
constant terminal velocity, leading to a slightly larger signal of the
gravitational waves background from bubble collisions due to its quadratic
dependence on the bubble collision efficiency factor, although the
$\gamma^2$-scaling friction itself has already suppressed the contribution from
bubble collisions compared to that with $\gamma^1$-scaling friction. We also
suggest a phenomenological parameterization for the out-of-equilibrium term in
the Boltzmann equation that could reproduce the recently found
$(\gamma^2-1)$-scaling of the friction term in the effective EOM of an
expanding bubble wall, which merits further study in future numerical

uncertainties is an essential requisite for a precise determination of light
nuclide primordial abundances. The recent measurement of the D(p,gamma)3He
radiative capture cross section by the LUNA collaboration, with its order 3%
error, represents an important step in improving the theoretical prediction for
Deuterium produced in the early universe. In view of this recent result, we
present in this paper a full analysis of its abundance, which includes a new
critical study of the impact of the other two main processes for Deuterium
burning, namely the deuteron-deuteron transfer reactions, D(d,p)3H and
D(d,n)3He. In particular, emphasis is given to the statistical method of
analysis of experimental data, to a quantitative study of the theoretical
uncertainties, and a comparison with similar studies presented in the recent
literature. We then discuss the impact of our study on the concordance of the
primordial nucleosynthesis stage with the Planck experiment results on the
baryon density Omegab h2 and the effective number of neutrino parameter Neff,
as function of the assumed value of the 4He mass fraction Yp. While after the
LUNA results, the value of Deuterium is quite precisely fixed, and points to a
value of the baryon density in excellent agreement with the Planck result, a
combined analysis also including Helium leads to two possible scenarios with
different predictions for Omegab h2 and Neff. We argue that new experimental
results on the systematics and the determination of Yp would be of great
importance in assessing the overall concordance of the standard cosmological

          <p>In this paper, we investigate the possibility of testing the weakly
interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM) models by applying the
simplest phenomenological model which introduces an interaction term between
dark energy (DE) and WIMP DM, i.e., $Q = 3\gamma_{DM} H\rho_{DM}$. In general,
the coupling strength $\gamma_{DE}$ is close to $0$ due to the interaction
between DE and WIMP DM is very weak, thus the effect of $\gamma_ {DE}$ on the
evolution of $Y$ associated with DM energy density can be safely ignored.
Meanwhile, our numerical calculation also indicates that $x_f\approx20$ is
associated with DM freeze-out temperature, which is the same as the vanishing
interaction scenario. As for DM relic density, it will be magnified by
$\frac{2-3\gamma_{DM}}{2}[{2\pi g_* m_{DM}^3}/{(45 s_0 x_f^3})]^{\gamma_{DM}}$
times, which provides a new way for us to test WIMP DM models. As an example,
we analyze the case in which WIMP DM is a scalar DM. (SGL+SNe+Hz) and
(GRBs+SNe+BAO+CMB) cosmological observations will give out
$\gamma_{DM}=0.134^{+0.17}_{-0.069}$ and $\gamma_{DM}=-0.0047\pm0.0046$,
respectively. After further considering the constraints from both the DM direct
detection experiment and DM relic density, we observe that the allowed
parameter space of the scalar DM model will be completely excluded for the
former cosmological observations, while it will increase for the latter ones.
Those two cosmological observations lead to a paradoxical conclusion. Thus we
wish the more accuracy of the cosmological observation can be obtained in the
near future to test the WIMP DM models.

          <p>The characterization and modeling of polarized foregrounds has become a
critical issue in the quest for primordial $B$-modes. A typical method to
proceed is to factorize and parametrize the spectral properties of foregrounds
and their scale dependence (i.e. assuming that foreground spectra are well
described everywhere by their sky average). Since in reality foreground
properties vary across the Galaxy, this assumption leads to inaccuracies in the
model that manifest themselves as biases in the final cosmological parameters
(in this case the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$). This is particularly relevant
for surveys over large fractions of the sky, such as the Simons Observatory
(SO), where the spectra should be modeled over a distribution of parameter
values. Here we propose a method based on the existing ``moment expansion''
approach to address this issue in a power-spectrum-based analysis that is
directly applicable in ground-based multi-frequency data. Additionally, the
method uses only a small set of parameters with simple physical interpretation,
minimizing the impact of foreground uncertainties on the final $B$-mode
constraints. We validate the method using SO-like simulated observations,
recovering an unbiased estimate of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ with standard
deviation $\sigma(r)\simeq0.003$, compatible with official forecasts. When
applying the method to the public BICEP2/Keck data, we find an upper bound
$r&lt;0.06$ ($95\%\,{\rm C.L.}$), compatible with the result found by BICEP2/Keck
when parametrizing spectral index variations through a scale-independent
frequency decorrelation parameter. We also discuss the formal similarities
between the power spectrum-based moment expansion and methods used in the
analysis of CMB lensing.

          <p>We study the effects of galaxy formation physics on the magnetization of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) using the IllustrisTNG simulations. We demonstrate
that large-scale regions affected by the outflows from galaxies and clusters
contain magnetic fields that are several orders of magnitude stronger than in
unaffected regions with the same electron density. Moreover, like magnetic
fields amplified inside galaxies, these magnetic fields do not depend on the
primordial seed, i.e. the adopted initial conditions for magnetic field
strength. We study the volume filling fraction of these strong field regions
and their occurrence in random lines of sight. As a first application, we use
these results to put bounds on the photon-axion conversion from spectral
distortion of the CMB. As photon-axion coupling grows with energy, stronger
constraints could potentially be obtained using data on the propagation of
gamma-ray photons through the IGM. Finally, we also briefly discuss potential
applications of our results to the Faraday Rotation measurements.

lensing and galaxy-CMB lensing. CMB lensing can help by breaking the
$M_\nu$-curvature degeneracy when combined with baryon acoustic oscillation

deal of constraining power, as the broadband shape of the power spectrum
contributes significantly to constraints. We also expand on previous work to
demonstrate how cosmology-independent constraints on $M_\nu$ can be extracted
by combining measurements of the scale-dependence in the power spectrum caused
by neutrino free-streaming with the full power of future CMB surveys. These
free-streaming constraints are independent of the optical depth to the CMB

          <p>There are currently several existing and proposed experiments designed to
probe sub-GeV dark matter (DM) using electron ionization in various materials.
The projected signal rates for these experiments assume that this ionization
yield arises only from DM scattering directly off electron targets, ignoring
secondary ionization contributions from DM scattering off nuclear targets. We
investigate the validity of this assumption and show that if sub-GeV DM couples
with comparable strength to both protons and electrons, as would be the case
for a dark photon mediator, the ionization signal from atomic scattering via
the Migdal effect scales with the atomic number $Z$ and 3-momentum transfer
$\mathbf{q}$ as $Z^2 \mathbf{q}^2$. The result is that the Migdal effect is
always subdominant to electron scattering when the mediator is light, but that
Migdal-induced ionization can dominate over electron scattering for heavy
mediators and DM masses in the hundreds of MeV range. We put these two
ionization processes on identical theoretical footing, address some theoretical
uncertainties in the choice of atomic wavefunctions used to compute rates, and
discuss the implications for DM scenarios where the Migdal process dominates,
including for XENON10, XENON100, and the recent XENON1T results on light DM
scattering.

law expected from a blackbody at $\sim$ 2.7 K at frequencies below $\sim 3$
GHz. We discuss the abundance of the low-energy photons from the perspective of
nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. We propose a mechanism of stochastic
frequency-diffusion, the counterpart to stochastic acceleration for charged
particles in a turbulent plasma, to modify the standard Kompaneets equation.
The resulting violation of the Einstein relation allows to take advantage of
low-frequency localization and finally leads to photon cooling. The new
equation predicts a frequency distribution in agreement with the absolute
temperature measurements of the cosmic background radiation down to about 20
MHz, for which we offer here an updated compilation. In that sense, the so

support such a model for negative values of the interaction parameter $\xi$, we

          <p>The current Hubble constant tension is usually presented by comparing
constraints on $H_0$ only. However, the post-recombination background cosmic
evolution is determined by two parameters in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model,
the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and today's matter energy fraction
($\Omega_{\rm{m}}$). If we therefore compare all constraints individually in
the $H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ plane, (1) various constraints can be treated as
independently as possible, (2) single-sided constraints are easier to consider,
(3) compatibility among different constraints can be viewed in a more robust
way, (4) the model dependence of each constraint is clear, and (5) whether or
not a nonstandard model is able to reconcile all constraints in tension can be
seen more effectively. We perform a systematic comparison of different
constraints in the $H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ space based on a flat $\Lambda$CDM
model, treating them as separately as possible. Constraints along different
degeneracy directions consistently overlap in one region of the space, with the
local measurement from Cepheid variable-calibrated supernovae being the most
outlying, followed by the time-delay strong-lensing result. Considering the
possibility that some nonstandard physics may reconcile the constraints, we
provide a general discussion on nonstandard models with modifications at high,
mid, or low redshifts, and the effect of local environmental factors. Due to
the different responses of individual constraints to a modified model, it is
not easy for nonstandard models to reconcile all constraints if none of them
have unaccounted-for systematic effects.

          <p>Theories of gravity that incorporate new scalar degrees of freedom typically
require screening mechanisms to ensure consistency with Solar System tests. One
widely-studied mechanism -- the chameleon -- can lead to violations of the
equivalence principle (EP), as screened and unscreened objects fall
differently. If the stars are screened but the surrounding dark matter is not,
this leads to asymmetry between leading and trailing streams. We provide
analytic estimates of the magnitude of this effect for realistic Galactic mass
distributions. Using a restricted N-body code, we simulate 4 satellites with a
range of masses and orbits, together with a variety of strengths of the fifth
force and screening levels of the Milky Way and satellite. The ratio of the
cumulative number function of stars in the leading and trailing stream as a
function of longitude from the satellite is computable from simulations,
measurable from the stellar data and can provide a direct test. We forecast
constraints for streams at large Galactocentric distances, using the specific
example case of Hu-Sawicki gravity. Streams with apocentres between 100 and 200
kpc provide attainable constraints at the level of $|f_{R0}| = 10^{-7}$. Still
more stringent constraints at the level of $10^{-7.5}$ or even $10^{-8}$ are
plausible provided the environmental screening of the satellite is accounted
for. These would be among the tightest astrophysical constraints to date. We
note further signatures of chameleon gravity: (i) the trailing stellar stream
may become detached from the dark matter progenitor if all the stars are lost,
(ii) in the extreme fifth force regime, striations in the stellar trailing tail
may develop, (iii) if the satellite is fully screened, its orbital frequency is
lower than that of the associated dark matter, which is preferentially
liberated into the leading tidal tail.

          <p>We study quadratic gravity $R^2+R_{[\mu\nu]}^2$ in the Palatini formalism
where the connection and the metric are independent. This action has a {\it
gauged} scale symmetry (also known as Weyl gauge symmetry) of Weyl gauge field
$v_\mu= (\tilde\Gamma_\mu-\Gamma_\mu)/2$, with $\tilde\Gamma_\mu$
($\Gamma_\mu$) the trace of the Palatini (Levi-Civita) connection,
respectively. The underlying geometry is non-metric due to the $R_{[\mu\nu]}^2$
term acting as a gauge kinetic term for $v_\mu$. We show that this theory has
an elegant spontaneous breaking of gauged scale symmetry and mass generation in
the absence of matter, where the necessary scalar field ($\phi$) is not added
ad-hoc to this purpose but is "extracted" from the $R^2$ term. The gauge field
becomes massive by absorbing the derivative term $\partial_\mu\ln\phi$ of the
Stueckelberg field ("dilaton"). In the broken phase one finds the
Einstein-Proca action of $v_\mu$ of mass proportional to the Planck scale
$M\sim \langle\phi\rangle$, and a positive cosmological constant. Below this
scale $v_\mu$ decouples, the connection becomes Levi-Civita and metricity and
Einstein gravity are recovered. These results remain valid in the presence of
non-minimally coupled scalar field (Higgs-like) with Palatini connection and
the potential is computed. In this case the theory gives successful inflation
and a specific prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $0.007\leq r \leq
0.01$ for current spectral index $n_s$ (at $95\%$CL) and N=60 efolds. This
value of $r$ is mildly larger than in inflation in Weyl quadratic gravity of
similar symmetry, due to different non-metricity. This establishes a connection
between non-metricity and inflation predictions and enables us to test such
theories by future CMB experiments.

          <p>In the universe's most massive galaxies, kinetic feedback from a central
supermassive black hole appears to limit star formation. Abundant
circumstantial evidence suggests that accumulation of cold gas near the central
black hole strongly boosts the feedback output, keeping the ambient medium in a
state marginally unstable to condensation and formation of cold gas clouds.
However, the ability of that mechanism to self-regulate may depend on numerous
environmental factors, including the depth of the potential well and the
pressure of the surrounding circumgalactic medium (CGM). Here we present a
suite of numerical simulations that explores the dependence of cold-fuelled
bipolar kinetic feedback on those environmental factors. Halo mass in this
simulation suite ranges from $2 \times 10^{12} \, M_\odot$ to $8 \times 10^{14}
\, M_\odot$. We include the spatially extended mass and energy input from the
massive galaxy's old stellar population, which is capable of sweeping gas out
of the galaxy and away from the central black hole if the confining CGM
pressure is sufficiently low. Our simulations show that this feedback mechanism
is tightly self-regulating in a massive galaxy with a deep central potential
and low CGM pressure, permitting only small amounts of multiphase gas to
accumulate and allowing almost no star formation. In a massive galaxy of
similar mass but a shallower central potential and greater CGM pressure the
same feedback mechanism is more episodic, producing extended multiphase gas and
occasionally allowing small rates of star formation ($\sim 0.1 \, M_\odot \,
{\rm yr}^{-1}$). At the low-mass end of the explored range the mechanism
becomes implausibly explosive, perhaps because the ambient gas initially has no
angular momentum, which would have reduced the amount of condensed gas capable
of fueling feedback.

          <p>The standard model of cosmology is underpinned by the assumption of the
statistical isotropy of the Universe. Observations of the cosmic microwave
background, galaxy distributions, and supernovae, among other media, support
the assumption of isotropy at scales $\gtrsim 100$\,Mpc. The recent detections
of gravitational waves from merging stellar-mass binary black holes provide a
new probe of anisotropy; complementary and independent of all other probes of
the matter distribution in the Universe. We present an analysis using a
spherical harmonic model to determine the level of anisotropy in the first
LIGO/Virgo transient catalog. We find that the ten binary black hole mergers
within the first transient catalog are consistent with an isotropic
distribution. We carry out a study of simulated events to assess the prospects
for future probes of anisotropy. Within a single year of operation,
third-generation gravitational-wave observatories will probe anisotropies with
an angular scale of $\sim36^\circ$ at the level of $\lesssim0.1\%$.

          <p>We present the temperature and polarization angular power spectra of the CMB
measured by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) from 5400 deg$^2$ of the
2013-2016 survey, which covers $&gt;$15000 deg$^2$ at 98 and 150 GHz. For this
analysis we adopt a blinding strategy to help avoid confirmation bias and,
related to this, show numerous checks for systematic error done before
unblinding. Using the likelihood for the cosmological analysis we constrain
secondary sources of anisotropy and foreground emission, and derive a
"CMB-only" spectrum that extends to $\ell=4000$. At large angular scales,
foreground emission at 150 GHz is $\sim$1% of TT and EE within our selected
regions and consistent with that found by Planck. Using the same likelihood, we
obtain the cosmological parameters for $\Lambda$CDM for the ACT data alone with
a prior on the optical depth of $\tau=0.065\pm0.015$. $\Lambda$CDM is a good
fit. The best-fit model has a reduced $\chi^2$ of 1.07 (PTE=0.07) with
$H_0=67.9\pm1.5$ km/s/Mpc. We show that the lensing BB signal is consistent
with $\Lambda$CDM and limit the celestial EB polarization angle to $\psi_P
=-0.07^{\circ}\pm0.09^{\circ}$. We directly cross correlate ACT with Planck and
observe generally good agreement but with some discrepancies in TE. All data on

silicon CCDs and wafers with a neutron beam that mimics the cosmic-ray neutron

          <p>Measurements of redshifted 21-cm emission of neutral hydrogen at &lt;30 MHz have
the potential to probe the cosmic "dark ages," a period of the universe's
history that remains unobserved to date. Observations at these frequencies are
exceptionally challenging because of bright Galactic foregrounds, ionospheric
contamination, and terrestrial radio-frequency interference. Very few sky maps
exist at &lt;30 MHz, and most have modest resolution. We introduce the Array of
Long Baseline Antennas for Taking Radio Observations from the Sub-Antarctic

with an order-of-magnitude improvement in resolution over existing data. The
ALBATROS array will consist of antenna stations that operate autonomously, each
recording baseband data that will be interferometrically combined offline. The
array will be installed on Marion Island and will ultimately comprise 10
stations, with an operating frequency range of 1.2-125 MHz and maximum baseline
lengths of ~20 km. We present the ALBATROS instrument design and discuss
pathfinder observations that were taken from Marion Island during 2018-2019.

          <p>We present a new realization of the resonant production of primordial black
holes as well as gravitational waves in a two-stage inflation model consisting
of a scalar field \phi with an axion-monodromy-like periodic structure in the
potential that governs the first stage and another field \chi with a
hilltop-like potential that dominates the second stage. The parametric
resonance seeded by the periodic structure at the first stage amplifies the
perturbations of both fields inside the Hubble radius. While the evolution of
the background trajectory experiences a turn as the oscillatory barrier height
increases, the amplified perturbations of \chi remain as they are and
contribute to the final curvature perturbation. It turns out that the
primordial power spectrum displays a significant resonant peak on small scales,
which can lead to an abundant production of primordial black holes.
Furthermore, gravitational waves are also generated from the resonantly
enhanced field perturbations during inflation, the amplitude of which may be
constrained by future gravitational wave interferometers.

features a multi-field amplification mechanism which leads to the generation of
a sharp peak in the inflationary power spectrum at small wavelengths
responsible for the production of primordial black holes. This mechanism is
significantly different from single-field models and requires a stochastic
treatment during an intermediate phase of the inflationary dynamics. We find
that the model leads to a successful phase of effective single-field
