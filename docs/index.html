          <p>We present the analysis of a new signature for light dark matter detection
with superfluid $^4$He: the emission of three phonons. We show that, in a
region of mass below the MeV, the kinematics of this process can offer a way to
reconstruct the dark matter interaction vertex, while providing background

          <p>Feebly Interacting Massive Particles (FIMPs) are dark matter candidates that
never thermalize in the early universe and whose production takes place via
decays and/or scatterings of thermal bath particles. If FIMPs interactions with
the thermal bath are renormalizable, a scenario known as freeze-in, production
is most efficient at temperatures around the mass of the bath particles and
insensitive to unknown physics at high temperatures. Working in a
model-independent fashion, we consider three different production mechanisms:
two-body decays, three-body decays, and binary collisions. We compute the FIMP
phase space distribution and matter power spectrum, and we investigate the
suppression of cosmological structures at small scales. Our results are lower
bounds on the FIMP mass. Finally, we study how to relax these constraints in
scenarios where FIMPs provide a sub-dominant dark matter component.

          <p>(Abridged) Exploiting the sensitivity and broad band width of NOEMA, we have
studied the molecular gas and dust in the galaxy HerBS-89a, at z=2.95. High
angular resolution images reveal a partial 1.0" diameter Einstein ring in the
dust continuum emission and the molecular emission lines of 12CO(9-8) and
H2O(2_02-1_11). We report the detection of the three fundamental transitions of
the molecular ion OH+, seen in absorption; the molecular ion CH+(1-0) seen in
absorption (and tentatively in emission); two transitions of amidogen (NH2),
seen in emission; and HCN(11-10) and/or NH(1_2-0_1) seen in absorption. The
NOEMA data are complemented with VLA data tracing the 12CO(1-0) emission line,
which provides a measurement of the total mass of molecular gas and an anchor
for a CO excitation analysis. In addition, we present HST imaging that reveals
the foreground lensing galaxy in the near-infrared. Together with data from the
GTC, we derive a photometric redshift of z(phot)~0.9 for the foreground lensing
galaxy. Modelling the lensing of HerBS-89a, we reconstruct the dust continuum
and molecular emission lines (magnified by a factor ~4-5) in the source plane.
The 12CO(9-8) and H2O emission lines have comparable spatial and kinematic
distributions; the source-plane reconstructions do not clearly distinguish
between a one-component and a two-component scenario, but the latter accounts
for the observed broad line widths. HerBS-89a is a powerful star forming galaxy
with a dust-to-gas ratio delta(GDR)~80, a SFR = 614 +/- 59 Msun/yr and a
depletion timescale tau(depl) = (3.4 +/- 1.0) 1e8 years. The OH+ and CH+
absorption lines, all have their main velocity component red-shifted by
\Delta(V)~100 km/s relative to the global CO reservoir. We argue that these
absorption lines trace a rare example of gas inflow towards the center of the
galaxy.

          <p>Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are standardizable candles, but for over a
decade, there has been a debate on how to properly account for their
correlations with host galaxy properties. Using the Bayesian hierarchical model
UNITY, we simultaneously fit for the SN Ia light curve and host galaxy
standardization parameters on a set of 103 Sloan Digital Sky Survey II SNe Ia.
We investigate the influences of host stellar mass, along with both localized
($r&lt;3$ kpc) and host-integrated average stellar ages, derived from stellar
population synthesis modeling. We find that the standardization for the
light-curve shape ($\alpha$) is correlated with host galaxy standardization
terms ($\gamma_i$) requiring simultaneous fitting. In addition, we find that
these correlations themselves are dependent on host galaxy stellar mass that
includes a shift in the color term ($\beta$) of $0.8 \mathrm{mag}$, only
significant at $1.2\sigma$ due to the small sample. We find a linear host mass
standardization term at the $3.7\sigma$ level, that by itself does not
significantly improve the precision of an individual SN Ia distance. However, a
standardization that uses both stellar mass and average local stellar age is
found to be significant at $&gt;3\sigma$ in the two-dimensional posterior space.
In addition, the unexplained scatter of SNe Ia absolute magnitude post
standardization, is reduced from $0.122^{+0.019}_{-0.018}$ to $0.109\pm0.017$
mag, or $\sim10\%$. We do not see similar improvements when using global ages.
This combination is consistent with either metallicity or line-of-sight dust
affecting the observed luminosity of SNe Ia.

          <p>The alignment between halo spins and the cosmic web is still poorly
understood despite being a widely studied topic. Here, we study this alignment
within the context of tidal torque theory (TTT) and deviations from it. To this
end, we analyze the evolution of the shape and spin direction of proto-haloes,
i.e. of all the volume elements associated to a $z=0$ halo, with respect to the
present-day filaments. We find that the major axis of proto-haloes undergoes a
major change, from being strongly perpendicular to the filament spine in the
initial conditions, to being preferentially aligned at the present time. In
comparison, the spin orientation shows only a mild evolution: it starts
slightly parallel to the filament spine, but the subsequent evolution, up to
$z{\sim}1$, gradually changes its orientation to preferentially perpendicular.
In order to analyze these signals in the TTT framework, we split the haloes
according to their net spin growth with respect to the median TTT expectation,
finding a clear correlation with the spin--filament alignment. At the present
time, haloes whose spin grew the most are the ones most perpendicular to the
filament spine, while haloes whose spin grew below the median TTT expectation
are typically more aligned. The dependence of spin directions on net spin
growth is already present in the initial conditions, and gets further modified
by late-time, $z&lt;2$, evolution. Also, spin directions mildly deviate from the
TTT predictions even at high redshift, indicating the need for extensions to
the model.

          <p>We perform the first simultaneous Bayesian parameter inference and optimal
reconstruction of the gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB), using 100 deg$^2$ of polarization observations from the SPTpol receiver
on the South Pole Telescope. These data reach noise levels as low as 5.8
$\mu$K-arcmin in polarization, which are low enough that the typically used
quadratic estimator (QE) technique for analyzing CMB lensing is significantly
sub-optimal. Conversely, the Bayesian procedure extracts all lensing
information from the data and is optimal at any noise level. We infer the
amplitude of the gravitational lensing potential to be
$A_\phi\,{=}\,0.949\,{\pm}\,0.122$ using the Bayesian pipeline, consistent with
our QE pipeline result, but with 17\% smaller error bars. The Bayesian analysis
also provides a simple way to account for systematic uncertainties, performing
a similar job as frequentist "bias hardening," and reducing the systematic
uncertainty on $A_\phi$ due to polarization calibration from almost half of the
statistical error to effectively zero. Finally, we jointly constrain $A_\phi$
along with $A_{\rm L}$, the amplitude of lensing-like effects on the CMB power
spectra, demonstrating that the Bayesian method can be used to easily infer
parameters both from an optimal lensing reconstruction and from the delensed
CMB, while exactly accounting for the correlation between the two. These
results demonstrate the feasibility of the Bayesian approach on real data, and
pave the way for future analysis of deep CMB polarization measurements with
SPT-3G, Simons Observatory, and CMB-S4, where improvements relative to the QE
can reach 1.5 times tighter constraints on $A_\phi$ and 7 times lower effective
lensing reconstruction noise.

achievable with the combination of cluster weak lensing and number counts, in
current and next-generation weak lensing surveys. We advocate an approach,
analogous to galaxy-galaxy lensing, in which the observables in each redshift
bin are the mean number counts and the mean weak lensing profile of clusters
above a mass proxy threshold. The primary astrophysical nuisance parameter is
the logarithmic scatter between the mass proxy and true mass near the
threshold. For surveys similar to the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Roman Space
Telescope High Latitude Survey (HLS), and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey
of Space and Time (LSST), we forecast aggregate precision on sigma_8 of 0.26%,
0.24%, and 0.10%, respectively, if the mass-observable scatter has an external
prior better than 0.01. These constraints would be degraded by about 20% for a
0.05 prior on scatter in the case of DES or HLS and for a 0.016 prior for LSST.
A one-month observing program with Roman Space Telescope targeting
approximately 2500 massive clusters could achieve a 0.5% constraint on
sigma_8(z=0.7) on its own, or a ~0.33% constraint in combination with the HLS.
Realizing the constraining power of clusters requires accurate knowledge of the
mass-observable relation and stringent control of systematics. We provide
analytic approximations to our numerical results that allow easy scaling to
other survey assumptions or other methods of cluster mass estimation.

          <p>Radio relics in galaxy clusters are extended synchrotron sources produced by
cosmic-ray electrons in the $\mu$G magnetic field. Many relics are found in the
cluster periphery and have a cluster-centric, narrow arc-like shape, which
suggests that the electrons are accelerated or re-accelerated by merger shock
fronts propagating outward in the intracluster plasma. In the X-ray, some
relics do exhibit such shocks at the location of the relic, but many do not. We
explore the possibility that radio relics trace not the shock fronts but the
shape of the underlying distribution of seed relativistic electrons, lit up by
a recent shock passage. We use magnetohydrodynamic simulations of cluster
mergers and include bubbles of relativistic electrons injected by jets from the
central AGN or from an off-center radio galaxy. We show that the merger-driven
gas motions (a) can advect the bubble cosmic rays to very large radii, and (b)
spread the relativistic seed electrons preferentially in tangential direction
-- along the gravitational equipotential surfaces -- producing extended,
filamentary or sheet-like regions of intracluster plasma enriched with aged
cosmic rays, which resemble radio relics. Once a shock front passes across such
a region, the sharp radio emission edges would trace the sharp boundaries of
these enriched regions rather than the front. We also show that these elongated
cosmic ray features are naturally associated with magnetic fields stretched
tangentially along their long axis, which could help explain the high
polarization of relics.

distribution of the fields value at the time when a given scale crosses out the
Hubble radius during inflation, which we show how to compute. This allows the
stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism to make concrete contact with observations. As
an application, we study how quantum diffusion at small scales (arising e.g. in
models leading to primordial black holes) affects the large-scale perturbations
observed in the cosmic microwave background. We find that even if those sets of
scales are well separated, large effects can arise from the distortion of the
classical relationship between field values and wavenumbers brought about by
quantum diffusion near the end of inflation. This shows that cosmic microwave
background measurements can set explicit constraints on the entire inflationary
potential down to the end of inflation.

conditions for a valid vacuum only at the expense of trivializing the graviton

de Sitter is deformed by corpuscular $1/N$ effects, similarly to

          <p>We present COSMIC BIRTH: COSMological Initial Conditions from Bayesian
Inference Reconstructions with THeoretical models: an algorithm to reconstruct
the primordial and evolved cosmic density fields from galaxy surveys on the
light-cone. The displacement and peculiar velocity fields are obtained from
forward modelling at different redshift snapshots given some initial cosmic
density field within a Gibbs-sampling scheme. This allows us to map galaxies,
observed in a light-cone, to a single high redshift and hereby provide tracers
and the corresponding survey completeness in Lagrangian space including
phase-space mapping. These Lagrangian tracers in turn permit us to efficiently
obtain the primordial density field, making the COSMIC BIRTH code general to
any structure formation model. Our tests are restricted for the time being to
Augmented Lagrangian Perturbation theory. We show how to robustly compute the
non-linear Lagrangian bias from clustering measurements in a numerical way,
enabling us to get unbiased dark matter field reconstructions at initial cosmic
times. We also show that we can greatly recover the information of the dark
matter field from the galaxy distribution based on a detailed simulation. Novel
key ingredients to this approach are a higher-order Hamiltonian sampling
technique and a non-diagonal Hamiltonian mass-matrix. This technique could be
used to study the Eulerian galaxy bias from galaxy surveys and could become an
ideal baryon acoustic reconstruction technique. In summary, this method
represents a general reconstruction technique, including in a self-consistent
way a survey mask, non-linear and non-local bias and redshift space
distortions, with an efficiency about 10 times superior to previous comparable
methods.

          <p>We propose a new scheme to reconstruct the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO)
signal, which contains key cosmological information, based on deep
convolutional neural networks (CNN). Trained with almost no fine-tuning, the
network can recover large-scale modes accurately in the test set: the
correlation coefficient between the true and reconstructed initial conditions
reaches $90\%$ at $k\leq 0.2 h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, which can lead to significant
improvements of the BAO signal-to-noise ratio down to
$k\simeq0.4h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Since this new scheme is based on the
configuration-space density field in sub-boxes, it is local and less affected
by survey boundaries than the standard reconstruction method, as our tests
confirm. We find that the network trained in one cosmology is able to
reconstruct BAO peaks in the others, i.e. recovering information lost to
non-linearity independent of cosmology. The accuracy of recovered BAO peak
positions is far less than that caused by the difference in the cosmology
models for training and testing, suggesting that different models can be
distinguished efficiently in our scheme. It is very promising that Our scheme
provides a different new way to extract the cosmological information from the
ongoing and future large galaxy surveys.

astrometry of extended sources into a new regime, and combine information from
the different elements of resolved galaxies. In an appendix we describe some

          <p>Within Type-I seesaw mechanism, Higgs mass can be dynamically generated via
quantum effects of the right handed neutrinos assuming the potential is nearly
conformal at the Ultra-Violet. The scenario, named as the "Neutrino Option"
allows RH neutrino mass scale upto $M \lesssim$ $10^7$ GeV to be consistent
with light neutrino masses, mixing and Higgs mass. Therefore, it is not
consistent with standard hierarchical thermal leptogenesis. Parameter space for
thermal resonant leptogenesis is highly constrained in this model. We point out
that non-thermal pair production of RH neutrinos from inflaton decay
corresponds in general to a mild degree of resonance in the CP asymmetry
parameter and allows RH mass scale to be smaller more than by an order of
magnitude than the thermal strong resonance case. Within the similar parameter
space of thermal leptogenesis, RH neutrinos can also be produced from inflaton
decay along with a Dark Matter having mass $M_{\rm DM}\lesssim$ 320 MeV. The
main constraint in the latter scenario comes from the Ly$\alpha$ constraints on
Dark Matter free streaming. We show in addition, that the Neutrino Option
introduces a 'phantom window' for the RH mass scale, in which contrary to the
usual scenarios, CP asymmetry parameter for leptogenesis decreases with the
increase of the RH mass scale and minimally fine-tuned seesaw models naturally
exhibit this `phantom window'.

focus on the linear galaxy bias $b_1$ and the coefficient $b_\phi$ of the
scale-dependent bias induced by PNG, which describe the response of galaxy
number counts to these two types of perturbations, respectively. We perform our
study using separate universe simulations, in which the effect of the
perturbations is mimicked by changes to the cosmological parameters: modified
cosmic matter density for $b_1$ and modified amplitude $\mathcal{A}_s$ of the
primordial scalar power spectrum for $b_\phi$. We find that the widely used
universality relation $b_\phi = 2\delta_c(b_1 - 1)$ is a poor description of
the bias of haloes and galaxies selected by stellar mass $M_*$, which is
instead described better by $b_\phi(M_*) = 2\delta_c(b_1(M_*) - p)$ with $p \in
[0.4, 0.7]$. This is explained by the different impact that matter
overdensities and local PNG have on the median stellar-to-halo-mass relation. A
simple model of this impact allows us to describe the stellar mass dependence
of $b_1$ and $b_\phi$ fairly well. Our results also show a nontrivial relation
between $b_1$ and $b_\phi$ for galaxies selected by color and black hole mass
accretion rate. Our results provide refined priors on $b_\phi$ for local PNG
constraints and forecasts using galaxy clustering. Given that the widely used
universality relation underpredicts $b_\phi(M_*)$, existing analyses may
underestimate the true constraining power on local PNG.

Horizon-AGN feel a sub-grid dynamical friction force, sourced by the

find that i) the fraction of spatially offset BHs increases with cosmic time,
ii) BHs live on prograde orbits in the plane of the galaxy with an orbital

is density-stratified, with the gas density being highest at the centre of the
cluster and decreasing radially outwards. As a result of this, Kolmogorov
(homogeneous, isotropic) turbulence theory does not apply to the ICM. The gas
motions are instead explained by anisotropic stratified turbulence, with the
stratification quantified by the perpendicular Froude number
($\mathrm{Fr}_\perp$). These turbulent motions are associated with density and
pressure fluctuations, which manifest as perturbations in X-ray surface
brightness maps of the ICM and as thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZ)

conducted 100 high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of stratified turbulence

the parameter space of subsonic rms Mach number ($\mathcal{M}$),
$\mathrm{Fr}_\perp$, and the ratio of entropy and pressure scale heights

different relaxation criteria. The morphology in mock X-ray and
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect images of clusters is studied with the $M$
indicator that is a combination of seven morphological parameters, and the
offset $\Delta$ between the peaks or centroids of X-ray and SZ maps and the
Brightest Central Galaxy position estimated from optical maps. We study the
efficiency of morphological indicators and the correlation with the dynamical
state of the combined $M$ and dynamical $\chi$ parameters, that have the
advantage of proving and collecting different aspects of the cluster structures
than single parameters. An evolution with the redshift of the dynamical state
is present, but the populations of the dynamical state classes differ inside
$R_{500}$ and $R_{200}$. The main source of contamination in relaxed fraction
inferred from morphological parameters is constituted by hybrid clusters. $M$
parameter describes with the same efficiency the morphology in X-ray and SZ
maps, with a correlation coefficient of $\rho=0.81$. A moderately strong
correlation between $M$ and $\chi$ is present, with a coefficient of
$\rho=-0.66$. The offset parameters based on centroids are more sensitive to
dynamical state than peaks positions offsets. The correlation with $\chi$ for
centroids is of the same order of $M$, with $\rho=-(0.63$-$0.67)$ respectively
for SZ or X-ray centroids.
