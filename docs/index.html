          <p>We propose a simple mechanism of light dark matter (DM) production from the
decay of the oscillating inflaton condensation. If the reheating temperature
after inflation is higher than the inflaton mass, which is of the same order of
the momentum of the DM at the time of the production, the DM momentum can be
suppressed compared to the temperature of the thermal plasma if the interaction
of the DM is weak enough. Consequently, the DM can be cold enough to avoid the
observational constraints on the warm DM, like the Lyman-$\alpha$ bound even if
the DM mass is small. We study the bosonic and fermionic DM production from the
inflaton decay, taking into account the effect of the stimulated emission and
Pauli blocking, respectively. In both cases, the DM can be cold and abundant
enough to be a viable candidate of the DM. We also apply our mechanism to the
production of isocurvature-problem-free axion DM and Dirac sea DM of
right-handed neutrino consistent the seesaw relation for the active neutrino

          <p>We present detailed constraints on the metallicity dependence of the high
mass X-ray binary (HMXB) X-ray luminosity function (XLF). We analyze ~5 Ms of
Chandra data for 55 actively star-forming galaxies at D &lt; 30 Mpc with gas-phase
metallicities spanning 12 + log(O/H) = 7-9.2. Within the galactic footprints,
our sample contains a total of 1311 X-ray point sources, of which ~49% are
expected to be HMXBs, with the remaining sources likely to be low-mass X-ray
binaries (LMXBs; ~22%) and unrelated background sources (~29%). We construct a
model that successfully characterizes the average HMXB XLF over the full
metallicity range. We demonstrate that the SFR-normalized HMXB XLF shows clear
trends with metallicity, with steadily increasing numbers of luminous and
ultraluminous X-ray sources (logL(erg/s) = 38-40.5) with declining metallicity.
However, we find that the low-luminosity (logL(erg/s) = 36-38) HMXB XLF appears
to show a nearly constant SFR scaling and slope with metallicity. Our model
provides a revised scaling relation of integrated LX/SFR versus 12 + log(O/H)
and a new characterization of its the SFR-dependent stochastic scatter. The
general trend of this relation is broadly consistent with past studies based on
integrated galaxy emission; however, our model suggests that this relation is
driven primarily by the high-luminosity end of the HMXB XLF. Our results have
implications for binary population synthesis models, the nature of
super-Eddington accreting objects (e.g., ultraluminous X-ray sources), recent
efforts to identify active galactic nucleus candidates in dwarf galaxies, and
the X-ray radiation fields in the early Universe during the epoch of cosmic
heating at z &gt; 10.

          <p>Dark matter (DM) scattering with nuclei in solid-state systems may produce
elastic nuclear recoil at high energies and single-phonon excitation at low
energies. When the dark matter momentum is comparable to the momentum spread of
nuclei bound in a lattice, $q_0 = \sqrt{2 m_N \omega_0}$ where $m_N$ is the
mass of the nucleus and $\omega_0$ is the optical phonon energy, an
intermediate scattering regime characterized by multi-phonon excitations
emerges. We study a greatly simplified model of a single nucleus in a harmonic
potential and show that, while the mean energy deposited for a given momentum
transfer $q$ is equal to the elastic value $q^2/(2m_N)$, the phonon occupation
number follows a Poisson distribution and thus the energy spread is $\Delta E =
q\sqrt{\omega_0/(2m_N)}$. This observation suggests that low-threshold
calorimetric detectors may have significantly increased sensitivity to sub-GeV
DM compared to the expectation from elastic scattering, even when the energy
threshold is above the single-phonon energy, by exploiting the tail of the
Poisson distribution for phonons above the elastic energy. We use a simple
model of electronic excitations to argue that this multi-phonon signal will
also accompany ionization signals induced from DM-electron scattering or the
Migdal effect. In well-motivated models where DM couples to a heavy,
kinetically-mixed dark photon, we show that these signals can probe
experimental milestones for cosmological DM production via thermal freeze-out,
including the thermal target for Majorana fermion DM.

          <p>In the advent of large scale surveys, individually modelling
strong-gravitational lenses and their counterpart time-delays in order to
precisely measure $H_0$ will become computationally expensive, and highly
complex. A complimentary approach is to study the cumulative distribution
function (CDF) of time-delays where the global population of lenses is modelled
along with $H_0$. In this paper we use a suite of hydro-dynamical simulations
to estimate the CDF of time-delays from doubly-imaged quasars for a realistic
distribution of lenses. We find that the CDFs exhibit large amounts of
halo-halo variance, regulated by the density profile inner slope and the total
mass within $5$kpc. With the objective of fitting to data, we compress the CDFs
using Principal Component Analysis and fit a Gaussian Processes Regressor
consisting of three physical features: the redshift of the lens, $z_{\rm L}$;
the power law index of the halo, $\alpha$, and the mass within $5$kpc, plus
four cosmological features. Assuming a flat Universe, we fit our model to 27
doubly-imaged quasars finding $H_0=71^{+2}_{-3}$km/s/Mpc, $z_{\rm L} =
0.36_{-0.09}^{+0.2} $, $\alpha=-1.8_{-0.1}^{+0.1}$,
$\log(M(&lt;5$kpc$)/M_\odot)=11.1_{-0.1}^{+0.1} $, $\Omega_{\rm M} =
0.3_{-0.04}^{+0.04} $ and $\Omega_{\rm \Lambda}=0.7_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$. We
compare our estimates of $z_{\rm L}$ and $\log(M(&lt;5$kpc$)/M_\odot)$ to the data
and find that within the sensitivity of the data, they are not systematically
biased. We generate mock CDFs and find with that the Vera Rubin Observatory
(VRO) could measure $\sigma/H_0$ to $&lt;3\%$, limited by the precision of the
model. If we are to exploit fully VRO, we require simulations that sample a
larger proportion of the lens population, with a variety of feedback models,
exploring all possible systematics.

          <p>(Abridged) Does inflation have to happen all in one go? The answer is a
resounding no! All cosmological problems can be solved by a sequence of short
bursts of cosmic acceleration, interrupted by short epochs of decelerated
expansion. The spectrum of perturbations will still match the CMB and LSS if
the earliest stage of the last ${\cal O}(50)-{\cal O}(60)$ efolds is at least
${\cal O}(15)$ efolds long. Other stages can be considerably shorter. But as
long as they add up to ${\cal O}(50)-{\cal O}(60)$ efolds and the stages of
decelerated expansion in between them are shorter and also overall last less,
the ensuing cosmology will pass muster. The presence of the interruptions
resets the efold clock of each accelerating stage, and changes its value at the
CMB pivot point. This change opens up the theory space, loosening the bounds.
In particular some models that seem excluded at ${\cal N}=60$ fit very well as
shorter stages with ${\cal N}=30$. Interesting predictions are that both the
scalar and tensor spectra of perturbations are rapidly modified at short
wavelengths. These features could be tested with future CMB spectroscopy
searches and with short wavelength primordial gravity probes. The spatial
curvature in these models can be larger than the largest wavelength scalar
perturbations, because $\Omega_{\tt k}$ evolves differently than the scalar
perturbations $\frac{\delta \rho}{\rho}|_{\tt S}$. Finally, with many short
stages of accelerated expansion, the abundance of reheating products from
previous accelerated stages does not get completely wiped out. This implies
that the universe may contain additional populations of particles, more rare
than the visible ones, or even primordial black holes, created during a late
decelerated epoch before last reheating, which may be dark matter.

that limit the sensitivity of searches for low-mass dark matter (DM) using
xenon time projection chambers. In the LUX detector, signatures of low-mass DM
interactions would be very low energy ($\sim$keV) scatters in the active target
that ionize only a few xenon atoms and seldom produce detectable scintillation
signals. In this regime, extra precaution is required to reject a complex set
of low-energy electron backgrounds that have long been observed in this class
of detector. Noticing backgrounds from the wire grid electrodes near the top
and bottom of the active target are particularly pernicious, we develop a
machine learning technique based on ionization pulse shape to identify and
reject these events. We demonstrate the technique can improve Poisson limits on
low-mass DM interactions by a factor of $2$-$7$ with improvement depending
heavily on the size of ionization signals. We use the technique on events in an
effective $5$ tonne$\cdot$day exposure from LUX's 2013 science operation to
place strong limits on low-mass DM particles with masses in the range
$m_{\chi}\in0.15$-$10$ GeV. This machine learning technique is expected to be
useful for near-future experiments, such as LZ and XENONnT, which hope to

          <p>The quantity $T_0$, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) monopole, is an
often neglected seventh parameter of the standard cosmological model. As well
as its variation affecting the physics of the CMB, the measurement of $T_0$ is
also used to calibrate the anisotropies, via the orbital dipole. We point out
that it is easy to misestimate the effect of $T_0$ because the CMB anisotropies
are conventionally provided in temperature units. In fact the anisotropies are
most naturally described as dimensionless and we argue for restoring the
convention of working with $\Delta T/T$ rather than $\Delta T$. As a free
cosmological parameter, $T_0$ most naturally only impacts the CMB power spectra
through late-time effects. Thus if we ignore the COBE-FIRAS measurement,
current CMB data only weakly constrain $T_0$. Even ideal future CMB data can at
best provide a percent-level constraint on $T_0$, although adding large-scale
structure data will lead to further improvement. The FIRAS measurement is so

          <p>In this work, a new generic parameterisation for $f(R)$ theories is
presented. Our proposal for a new equation of state can reproduce an
$f(R)$-like evolution that describes late and early time universe within
1-$\sigma$ C.L when we use a combination of distance ladder measurements based
on Cosmic Chronometers, Supernovae Ia, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and finally,
Cosmic Microwave Background and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Indeed, a family of
$f(R)$ cosmological viable scenarios were extensively analysed in the light of
late-time measurements, were an Eos reaches a precision better than $99.2\%$
over the numerical solutions for the field equations of this theory. Moreover,
in this proposal we extended the study to find constraints at the very early
time that can satisfy the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data on helium fraction,
$Y_{p}$. To perform this analysis, and with our generic $w_{f(R)}$ --which can
be seemed it at the same level as other parameterisations into the pipeline and
analysis of observational surveys-- we consider both background and linear
perturbations evolution and constrain beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM six
cosmological parameters. While there are strong constraints at background on
the free parameters of our $w_{f(R)}$, we found that $f(R)$ background viable
models can set early constraints to the current Hubble constant $H_0$, which is
in agreement with CMB data, but when late-time model-independent measurements
are considered, $H_0$ is fully compatible with the $R^{H18}$ value. Finally, as
an extension of these results, our proposal is capable to distinguish between
$f(R)$ scenarios at both routes of the distance ladder showing a good approach
to modify gravity at this level.

          <p>Galaxy imaging surveys observe a vast number of objects that are affected by
the instrument's Point Spread Function (PSF). Weak lensing missions, in
particular, aim at measuring the shape of galaxies, and PSF effects represent
an important source of systematic errors which must be handled appropriately.
This demands a high accuracy in the modelling as well as the estimation of the
PSF at galaxy positions. Sometimes referred to as non-parametric PSF
estimation, the goal of this paper is to estimate a PSF at galaxy positions,
starting from a set of noisy star image observations distributed over the focal
plane. To accomplish this, we need our model to first of all, precisely capture
the PSF field variations over the Field of View (FoV), and then to recover the
PSF at the selected positions. This paper proposes a new method, coined MCCD
(Multi-CCD PSF modelling), that creates, simultaneously, a PSF field model over
all of the instrument's focal plane. This allows to capture global as well as
local PSF features through the use of two complementary models which enforce
different spatial constraints. Most existing non-parametric models build one
model per Charge Coupled Device (CCD), which can lead to difficulties in
capturing global ellipticity patterns. We first test our method on a realistic
simulated dataset comparing it with two state-of-the-art PSF modelling methods
(PSFEx and RCA). We outperform both of them with our proposed method. Then we
contrast our approach with PSFEx on real data from CFIS (Canada France Imaging
Survey) that uses the CFHT (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope). We show that our
PSF model is less noisy and achieves a 22% gain on pixel Root Mean Squared
Error (RMSE) with respect to PSFEx. We present, and share the code of, a new
PSF modelling algorithm that models the PSF field on all the focal plane that
is mature enough to handle real data.

          <p>The tension between measurements of the Hubble constant obtained at different
redshifts may provide a hint of new physics active in the relatively early
universe, around the epoch of matter-radiation equality. A leading paradigm to
resolve the tension is a period of early dark energy, in which a scalar field
contributes a subdominant part of the energy budget of the universe at this
time. This scenario faces significant fine-tuning problems which can be
ameliorated by a non-trivial coupling of the scalar to the standard model
neutrinos. These become non-relativistic close to the time of matter-radiation
equality, resulting in an energy injection into the scalar that kick-starts the
early dark energy phase, explaining its coincidence with this seemingly
unrelated epoch. We present a minimal version of this neutrino-assisted early
dark energy model, and perform a detailed analysis of its predictions and
theoretical constraints. We consider both particle physics constraints -- that
the model constitute a well-behaved effective field theory for which the
quantum corrections are under control, so that the relevant predictions are
within its regime of validity -- and the constraints provided by requiring a
consistent cosmological evolution from early through to late times. Our work
paves the way for testing this scenario using cosmological data sets.

          <p>Recently, the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) and secondary
gravitational waves (GWs) due to enhanced scalar power on small scales have
garnered considerable attention in the literature. Often, the mechanism
considered to arrive at such enhanced power involves a modification of the
standard slow roll inflationary dynamics, achieved with the aid of fine-tuned
potentials. In this work, we investigate another well known method to generate
features in the power spectrum wherein the initial state of the perturbations
is assumed to be squeezed states. This approach is free from the fine-tuning
challenges faced in constructing inflationary potentials to achieve the
enhancement of scalar power at small scales. It is known that, for squeezed
initial states, the scalar bispectrum is strongly scale dependent and the
consistency condition governing the scalar bispectrum in the squeezed limit is
violated. In fact, the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{_{\rm NL}}$ characterizing
the scalar bispectrum proves to be inversely proportional to the squeezed mode
and this dependence enhances its amplitude at large wave numbers making it
highly sensitive to even a small deviation from the standard Bunch-Davies
vacuum. These aspects can possibly aid in leading to enhanced formation of PBHs
and generation of secondary GWs. However, we find that the backreaction due to
the excited states severely limits the extent of deviation from the
Bunch-Davies vacuum at large wave numbers. We argue that, unless the issue of
backreaction is circumvented, squeezed initial states cannot lead to a
substantial increase in power on small scales that is required for enhanced
formation of PBHs and generation of secondary GWs.

develop an identification algorithm based on two standard tools: the Minimal

analysis on the densest dark matter filaments, we found that the radial density

the filament depends on the masses of the halos at the filament ends. We also
found that the infall velocities follow a cross-pattern near the saddle point,
being perpendicular to the filament spine when approaching from low-density

filament. Following theoretical prescriptions, we estimate the linear density
from the transverse velocity dispersion, finding a good correspondence with the

approach that is exact up to the temperature dependence of the speed of sound

the hydrodynamic analysis are the speed of sound in the broken phase and a
linear combination of the energy and pressure differences between the two
phases which we call pseudotrace (normalized to the enthalpy in the broken

yields the conventional trace of the energy-momentum tensor for a relativistic
plasma (with speed of sound squared of one third). We study this approach in
several realistic models of the phase transition and also provide a code
snippet that can be used to determine the efficiency coefficient for a given
phase transition strength and speed of sound. It turns out that our approach is
accurate to the percent level for moderately strong phase transitions, while
former approaches give at best the right order of magnitude.

of the three-dimensional power spectrum of the $E$-mode field of halo shapes
with the matter/halo distribution, $P_{\delta E}^{(\ell)}(k)$ (or
$P^{(\ell)}_{{\rm h}E}$), and those of the auto-power spectrum of the $E$ mode,
$P^{(\ell)}_{EE}(k)$, based on the $E$/$B$-mode decomposition. The IA power
spectra have non-vanishing amplitudes over the linear to nonlinear scales, and
the large-scale amplitudes at $k\lesssim 0.1~h~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ are related to
the matter power spectrum via a constant coefficient ($A_{\rm IA}$), similar to
the linear bias parameter of galaxy or halo density field. We find that the
cross- and auto-power spectra $P_{\delta E}$ and $P_{EE}$ at nonlinear scales,
$k\gtrsim 0.1~h~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, show different $k$-dependences relative to the
matter power spectrum, suggesting a violation of the nonlinear alignment model
commonly used to model contaminations of cosmic shear signals. The IA power
spectra exhibit baryon acoustic oscillations, and vary with halo samples of
different masses, redshifts and cosmological parameters ($\Omega_{\rm m},
S_8$). The cumulative signal-to-noise ratio for the IA power spectra is about
60% of that for the halo density power spectrum, where the super-sample
covariance is found to give a significant contribution to the total covariance.
Thus our results demonstrate that the IA power spectra of galaxy shapes,
measured from imaging and spectroscopic surveys for an overlapping area of the
sky, can be used to probe the underlying matter power spectrum, the primordial
curvature perturbations, and cosmological parameters, in addition to the
standard galaxy density power spectrum.

          <p>We report novel cosmological constraints obtained from cosmic voids in the
final BOSS DR12 dataset. They arise from the joint analysis of geometric and
dynamic distortions of average void shapes (i.e., the stacked void-galaxy
cross-correlation function) in redshift space. Our model uses tomographic
deprojection to infer real-space void profiles and self-consistently accounts
for the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and redshift-space distortions (RSD)
without any prior assumptions on cosmology or structure formation. It is
derived from first physical principles and provides an extremely good
description of the data at linear perturbation order. We validate this model
with the help of mock catalogs and apply it to the final BOSS data to constrain
the RSD and AP parameters $f/b$ and $D_AH/c$, where $f$ is the linear growth
rate, $b$ the linear galaxy bias, $D_A$ the comoving angular diameter distance,
$H$ the Hubble rate, and $c$ the speed of light. In addition, we include two
nuisance parameters in our analysis to marginalize over potential systematics.
We obtain $f/b=0.540\pm0.091$ and $D_AH/c=0.588\pm0.004$ from the full void
sample at a mean redshift of $z=0.51$. In a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, this
implies $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.312\pm0.020$ for the present-day matter density
parameter. When we use additional information from the survey mocks to
calibrate our model, these constraints improve to $f/b=0.347\pm0.023$,
$D_AH/c=0.588\pm0.003$, and $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.310\pm0.017$. However, we
emphasize that the calibration depends on the specific model of cosmology and
structure formation assumed in the mocks, so the calibrated results should be
considered less robust. Nevertheless, our calibration-independent constraints
are among the tightest of their kind to date, demonstrating the immense
potential of using cosmic voids for cosmology in current and future data.

          <p>We present -- and make publicly available -- accurate and precise photometric
redshifts in the ACS footprint from the COSMOS field for objects with
$i_{\mathrm{AB}}\leq 23$. The redshifts are computed using a combination of
narrow band photometry from PAUS, a survey with 40 narrow bands spaced at
$100\r{A}$ intervals covering the range from $4500\r{A}$ to $8500\r{A}$, and 26
broad, intermediate, and narrow bands covering the UV, visible and near
infrared spectrum from the COSMOS2015 catalogue. We introduce a new method that
models the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) as a linear combination of
continuum and emission line templates and computes its Bayes evidence,
integrating over the linear combinations. The correlation between the UV
luminosity and the OII line is measured using the 66 available bands with the
zCOSMOS spectroscopic sample, and used as a prior which constrains the relative
flux between continuum and emission line templates. The flux ratios between the
OII line and $\mathrm{H}_{\alpha}$, $\mathrm{H}_{\beta}$ and $\mathrm{OIII}$
are similarly measured and used to generate the emission line templates.
Comparing to public spectroscopic surveys via the quantity
$\Delta_z\equiv(z_{\mathrm{photo}}-z_{\mathrm{spec}})/(1+z_{\mathrm{spec}})$,
we find the photometric redshifts to be more precise than previous estimates,
with $\sigma_{68}(\Delta_z) \approx (0.003, 0.009)$ for galaxies at magnitude
$i_{\mathrm{AB}}\sim18$ and $i_{\mathrm{AB}}\sim23$, respectively, which is
$3\times$ and $1.66\times$ tighter than COSMOS2015. Additionally, we find the
redshifts to be very accurate on average, yielding a median of the $\Delta_z$
distribution compatible with $|\mathrm{median}(\Delta_z)|\leq0.001$ at all
redshifts and magnitudes considered. Both the added PAUS data and new
methodology contribute significantly to the improved results.

          <p>A number of current and future experiments aim to detect the reionization of
neutral hydrogen by the first stars and galaxies in the Universe via the
redshifted 21cm line. Using the \textsc{BlueTides} simulation, we investigate
the measurement of an \textit{average} ionised region towards the beginning of
reionization by stacking redshifted 21cm images around optically identified
bright galaxies using mock observations. We find that with an SKA 1000 hour
observation, assuming perfect foreground subtraction, a $5\sigma$ detection of
a stacked HII region can be made with 30 images around some of the brightest
galaxies in \textsc{bluetides} (brighter than $M_{UV} &lt; -22.75$) at $z=9$
(corresponding to a neutral fraction of 90.1 \% in our model). We present
simulated relationships between the UV magnitude of galaxies, the sizes of the
ionised regions they reside in, and the shape of the stacked profiles. These
mock observations can also distinguish between scenarios where the IGM is in
net emission or absorption of 21cm photons. Once 21cm foreground contamination
is included, we find that even with up to 200 images around these rare, bright
galaxies, only a tentative $&gt; 1\sigma$ detection will be possible. However,
partial foreground subtraction substantially improves signal-to-noise. For
example, we predict that reducing the area of Fourier space dominated by
foregrounds by 50 (80) percent will allow $&gt; 3\sigma$ ($&gt; 5\sigma$) detections
of ionised regions at $z=9$.

          <p>Inflation Gravity Waves B-Modes polarization detection is the ultimate goal
of modern large angular scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments
around the world. A big effort is undergoing with the deployment of many
ground-based, balloon-borne and satellite experiments using different methods
to separate this faint polarized component from the incoming radiation. One of
the largely used technique is the Stokes Polarimetry that uses a rotating
half-wave plate (HWP) and a linear polarizer to separate and modulate the
polarization components with low residual cross-polarization. This paper
describes the QUBIC Stokes Polarimeter highlighting its design features and its
performances. A common systematic with these devices is the generation of large
spurious signals synchronous with the rotation and proportional to the
emissivity of the optical elements. A key feature of the QUBIC Stokes
Polarimeter is to operate at cryogenic temperature in order to minimize this
unwanted component. Moving efficiently this large optical element at low
temperature constitutes a big engineering challenge in order to reduce friction
power dissipation. Big attention has been given during the designing phase to
minimize the differential thermal contractions between parts. The rotation is
driven by a stepper motor placed outside the cryostat to avoid thermal load
dissipation at cryogenic temperature. The tests and the results presented in
this work show that the QUBIC polarimeter can easily achieve a precision below
0.1{\deg} in positioning simply using the stepper motor precision and the
optical absolute encoder. The rotation induces only few mK of extra power load
on the second cryogenic stage (~ 8 K).

          <p>Forthcoming large photometric surveys for cosmology require precise and
accurate photometric redshift (photo-z) measurements for the success of their
main science objectives. However, to date, no method has been able to produce
photo-$z$s at the required accuracy using only the broad-band photometry that
those surveys will provide. An assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of
current methods is a crucial step in the eventual development of an approach to
meet this challenge. We report on the performance of 13 photometric redshift
code single value redshift estimates and redshift probability distributions
(PDZs) on a common set of data, focusing particularly on the 0.2--2.6 redshift
range that the Euclid mission will probe. We design a challenge using emulated
Euclid data drawn from three photometric surveys of the COSMOS field. The data
are divided into two samples: one calibration sample for which photometry and
redshifts are provided to the participants; and the validation sample,
containing only the photometry, to ensure a blinded test of the methods.
Participants were invited to provide a redshift single value estimate and a PDZ
for each source in the validation sample, along with a rejection flag that
indicates sources they consider unfit for use in cosmological analyses. The
performance of each method is assessed through a set of informative metrics,
using cross-matched spectroscopic and highly-accurate photometric redshifts as
the ground truth. We show that the rejection criteria set by participants are
efficient in removing strong outliers, sources for which the photo-z deviates
by more than 0.15(1+z) from the spectroscopic-redshift (spec-z). We also show
that, while all methods are able to provide reliable single value estimates,
several machine-learning methods do not manage to produce useful PDZs.

          <p>We present a new high-precision parametric strong lensing model of the galaxy
cluster MACS J0416.1-2403, at z=0.396, which takes advantage of the MUSE Deep
Lensed Field (MDLF), with 17.1h integration in the northeast region of the
cluster, and Hubble Frontier Fields data. We spectroscopically identify 182
multiple images from 48 background sources at 0.9&lt;z&lt;6.2, and 171 cluster member
galaxies. Several multiple images are associated to individual clumps in
multiply lensed resolved sources. By defining a new metric, which is sensitive
to the gradients of the deflection field, we show that we can accurately
reproduce the positions of these star-forming knots despite their vicinity to
the model critical lines. The high signal-to-noise ratio of the MDLF spectra
enables the measurement of the internal velocity dispersion of 64 cluster
galaxies, down to m(F160W)=22. This allowed us to independently estimate the
contribution of the subhalo mass component of the lens model from the measured
Faber-Jackson scaling relation. Our best reference model, which represents a
significant step forward compared to our previous analyses, was selected from a
comparative study of different mass parametrizations. The root-mean-square
displacement between the observed and model-predicted image positions is only
0.40", which is 33% smaller than in all previous models. The mass model appears
to be particularly well constrained in the MDLF region. We characterize the
robustness of the magnification map at varying distances from the model
critical lines and the total projected mass profile of the cluster.

          <p>One of the most interesting candidates for dark matter are massive real
scalar particles. A well-motivated example is from a pure Yang-Mills hidden
sector, which locks up into glueballs in the early universe. The lightest
glueball states are scalar particles and can act as a form of bosonic dark
matter. If self-interactions are repulsive this can potentially lead to very
massive boson stars, where the inward gravitational force is balanced by the
repulsive self-interaction. This can also arise from elementary real scalars
with a regular potential. In the literature it has been claimed that this
allows for astrophysically significant boson stars with high compactness, which
could undergo binary mergers and generate detectable gravitational waves. Here
we show that previous analyses did not take into proper account $3 \to 2$ and
$4 \to 2$ quantum mechanical annihilation processes in the core of the star,
while other work misinterpreted the classical $3 \to 1$ process. In this work,
we compute the annihilation rates, finding that massive stars will rapidly
decay from the $3 \to 2$ or $4 \to 2$ processes (while the $3 \to 1$ process is
typically small). Using the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations, we also estimate
the binding energy of these stars, showing that even the densest stars do not
have quite enough binding energy to prevent annihilations. For such boson stars
to live for the current age of the universe and to be consistent with bounds on
dark matter scattering in galaxies, we find the following upper bound on their
mass for $O(1)$ self-interaction couplings: $M_*&lt;10^{-18}M_{sun}$ when $3 \to
2$ processes are allowed and $M_*&lt;10^{-11}M_{sun}$ when only $4 \to 2$
processes are allowed. We also estimate destabilization from parametric
resonance which can considerably constrain the phase space further.
Furthermore, such stars are required to have very small compactness to be long
lived.

relaxation criteria that come from observation measures: the morphology in mock
X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect images of galaxy clusters -- the $M$
indicator which is a combination of seven morphological parameters, and the
offsets $\Delta$ between the peaks or centroids of X-ray and SZ maps and the
Brightest Central Galaxy (BCG) position estimated from optical maps. We study
the efficiency of morphological indicators and the correlations with the
dynamical state of the combined $M$ and dynamical $\chi$ parameters, that have
the advantage of proving and collecting different aspects of the cluster
structures than single parameters. An evolution with the redshift of the
dynamical state is present, but the populations of the dynamical state classes
differ when different radii are used. The main source of contamination in
relaxed fraction inferred from morphological parameters is constituted by
hybrid clusters. $M$ combined parameter describes with the same efficiency the
morphology in X-ray and SZ maps, with a correlation coefficient of $\rho=0.81$.
A moderately strong correlation between $M$ and $\chi$ is present, with a
coefficient of $\rho=-0.66$. The offset parameters based on centroids are more
sensitive to dynamical state than peaks positions offsets. The correlation with
$\chi$ for centroids is of the same order of $M$, with $\rho=-(0.63$-$0.67)$ if
SZ or X-ray centroids are respectively used.

        <div class="mt-2 article-body">
          <p>We study the cosmology of a string derived supersymmetric flipped $SU(5)$
model in the context of free-fermionic heterotic constructions that allow full
calculability of the effective supergravity in perturbation theory around the
fermionic vacuum where all string moduli have fixed values. The model has 3
generations of chiral families and a Higgs sector leading to particle
phenomenology consistent with low energy data, that has been extensively
studied in the past. Here, we show that it can also accommodate a novel
successful cosmology, based on the no-scale effective supergravity derived from
string theory as well as an appropriate induced superpotential suppressed by
five powers of the string scale. It utilises two gauge singlet chiral
superfields present in the low energy spectrum: the inflaton $y$, identified as
the superpartner of a state mixed with R-handed neutrinos, %of the heaviest
generation, and the goldstino $z$ with a superpotential of the form $W_I=M_I
z(y-\lambda y^2)$ (in supergravity units) where $\lambda$ is a dimensionless
${\cal O}\left(1\right)$ parameter and $M_I$ the mass scale of inflation
generated at 5th order by the breaking of an anomalous $U(1)_A$ gauge symmetry,
characteristic of heterotic string chiral vacua. The resulting scalar potential
leads to Starobinsky type inflation. Our results can be easily generalised to a
large class of models with similar properties.
