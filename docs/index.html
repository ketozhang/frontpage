          <p>Obtaining accurately calibrated redshift distributions of photometric samples
is one of the great challenges in photometric surveys like LSST, Euclid, HSC,
KiDS, and DES. We combine the redshift information from the galaxy photometry
with constraints from two-point functions, utilizing cross-correlations with
spatially overlapping spectroscopic samples. Our likelihood framework is
designed to integrate directly into a typical large-scale structure and weak
lensing analysis based on two-point functions. We discuss efficient and
accurate inference techniques that allow us to scale the method to the large
samples of galaxies to be expected in LSST. We consider statistical challenges
like the parametrization of redshift systematics, discuss and evaluate
techniques to regularize the sample redshift distributions, and investigate
techniques that can help to detect and calibrate sources of systematic error
using posterior predictive checks. We evaluate and forecast photometric
redshift performance using data from the CosmoDC2 simulations, within which we
mimic a DESI-like spectroscopic calibration sample for cross-correlations.
Using a combination of spatial cross-correlations and photometry, we show that
we can provide calibration of the mean of the sample redshift distribution to
an accuracy of at least $0.002(1+z)$, consistent with the LSST-Y1 science
requirements for weak lensing and large-scale structure probes.

          <p>Constraints on the time-scales of quasar activity are key to understanding
the formation and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), quasar triggering
mechanisms, and possible feedback effects on their host galaxies. However,
observational estimates of this so-called quasar lifetime are highly uncertain
(t_Q~10^4-10^9 yr), because most methods are indirect and involve many
model-dependent assumptions. Direct evidence of earlier activity is gained from
the higher ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the quasar
environs, observable as enhanced Ly$\alpha$ transmission in the so-called
proximity zone. Due to the ~30 Myr equilibration time-scale of HeII in the z~3
IGM, the size of the HeII proximity zone depends on the time the quasar had
been active before our observation t_on&lt;t_Q, enabling up to $\pm$0.2 dex
precise measurements of individual quasar on-times that are comparable to the
e-folding time-scale t_S~44 Myr of SMBH growth. Here we present the first
statistical sample of 13 accurate and precise measurements of HeII quasar
proximity zone sizes from science-grade (signal-to-noise ratio ~3) Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) spectra, spanning ~2 to ~15 proper Mpc. Comparing these sizes
to predictions from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with
one-dimensional radiative transfer, we infer a broad range of quasar on-times
from t_on&lt;1 Myr to t_on&gt;30 Myr that does not depend on quasar luminosity, black
hole mass, or Eddington ratio. These results point to episodic quasar activity
over a long duty cycle, but do not rule out substantial SMBH growth during
phases of radiative inefficiency or obscuration.

          <p>We study the evolving environment dependence of mass accretion by dark haloes
in simulations of cold and warm dark matter (CDM and WDM) cosmologies. The
latter allows us to probe the nature of halo growth at scales below the WDM
half-mode mass, which form an extreme regime of nonlinear collisionless
dynamics and offer an excellent test-bed for ideas relating to hierarchical
growth. As environmental proxies, we use the local halo-centric matter density
$\delta$ and tidal anisotropy $\alpha$, as well as large-scale halo bias $b_1$.
Our analysis, while reproducing known trends for environment-dependent
accretion in CDM, as well as the comparison between accretion in CDM and WDM,
reveals several interesting new features. As expected from excursion set
models, WDM haloes have higher specific accretion rates, dominated by the
accretion of diffuse mass, as compared to CDM haloes. For low-mass WDM haloes,
we find that the environment-dependence of both diffuse mass accretion as well
as accretion by mergers is almost fully explained by $\alpha$. For the other
cases, $\delta$ plays at least a comparable role. We detect, for the first
time, a significant and evolving assembly bias due to diffuse mass accretion
for low-mass CDM and WDM haloes (after excluding splashback objects), with a
$z=0$ strength higher than with almost all known secondary variables and
largely explained by $\alpha$. Our results place constraints on semi-analytical
merger tree algorithms, which in turn could affect the predictions of galaxy
evolution models based on them.

          <p>The time frame in which hydrogen reionization occurred is highly uncertain,
but can be constrained by observations of Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission
from distant sources. Neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM)
attenuates Ly$\alpha$ photons emitted by galaxies. As reionization progressed
the IGM opacity decreased, increasing Ly$\alpha$ visibility. The galaxy
Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function (LF) is thus a useful tool to constrain the
timeline of reionization. In this work, we model the Ly$\alpha$ LF as a
function of redshift, $z=5-10$, and average IGM neutral hydrogen fraction,
$\overline{x}_{HI}$. We combine the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity probability
distribution obtained from inhomogeneous reionization simulations with a model
for the UV LF to model the Ly$\alpha$ LF. As the neutral fraction increases,
the average number density of Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies decreases, and are
less luminous, though for $\overline{x}_{HI} \lesssim 0.4$ there is only a
small decrease of the Ly$\alpha$ LF. We use our model to infer the IGM neutral
fraction at $z=6.6, 7.0, 7.3$ from observed Ly$\alpha$ LFs. We conclude that
there is a significant increase in the neutral fraction with increasing
redshift: $\overline{x}_{HI}(z=6.6)=0.08^{+ 0.08}_{- 0.05}, \,
\overline{x}_{HI}(z=7.0)=0.28 \pm 0.05$ and $\overline{x}_{HI}(z=7.3)=0.69 \pm
0.11$. We predict trends in the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity density and Schechter
parameters as a function of redshift and the neutral fraction. We find that the
Ly$\alpha$ luminosity density decreases as the universe becomes more neutral.
Furthermore, as the neutral fraction increases, the faint-end slope of the
Ly$\alpha$ LF steepens, and the characteristic Ly$\alpha$ luminosity shifts to
lower values, concluding that the evolving shape of the Ly$\alpha$ LF -- not
just its integral -- is an important tool to study reionization.

          <p>The precision anticipated from next-generation cosmic microwave background
(CMB) surveys will create opportunities for characteristically new insights
into cosmology. Secondary anisotropies of the CMB will have an increased
importance in forthcoming surveys, due both to the cosmological information
they encode and the role they play in obscuring our view of the primary
fluctuations. Quadratic estimators have become the standard tools for
reconstructing the fields that distort the primary CMB and produce secondary
anisotropies. While successful for lensing reconstruction with current data,
quadratic estimators will be sub-optimal for the reconstruction of lensing and
other effects at the expected sensitivity of the upcoming CMB surveys. In this
paper we describe a convolutional neural network, ResUNet-CMB, that is capable
of the simultaneous reconstruction of two sources of secondary CMB
anisotropies, gravitational lensing and patchy reionization. We show that the
ResUNet-CMB network significantly outperforms the quadratic estimator at low
noise levels and is not subject to the lensing-induced bias on the patchy
reionization reconstruction that would be present with a straightforward
application of the quadratic estimator.

          <p>In the early Universe, as well as in supernovae and merging neutron stars,
neutrinos have such high densities that they affect each other and exhibit
collective flavor oscillations. A crucial ingredient for fast collective flavor
oscillations is that the electron lepton number (ELN) distribution changes its
sign as a function of direction, i.e., has a zero crossing. We present a study
in two dimensions and show how fast flavor oscillations depend on the ELN and
its crossings. We show that a large number of crossings can inhibit flavor
oscillations. This may be a natural self-limiting mechanism that stabilizes the
flavor content of the dense neutrino gas in a vast majority of scenarios,
especially the early Universe, where the angular distributions for all flavors
are very similar and crossings occur mainly due to fluctuations.

          <p>The cusp-core problem is one of the main challenges of the cold dark matter
paradigm on small scales: the density of a dark matter halo is predicted to
rise rapidly toward the center as rho ~ r^alpha with alpha between -1 and -1.5,
while such a cuspy profile has not been clearly observed. We have carried out
the spatially-resolved mapping of gas dynamics toward a nearby ultra-diffuse
galaxy (UDG), AGC 242019. The derived rotation curve of dark matter is well
fitted by the cuspy profile as described by the Navarro-Frenk-White model,
while the cored profiles including both the pseudo-isothermal and Burkert
models are excluded. The halo has alpha=-(0.90+-0.08) at the innermost radius
of 0.67 kpc, Mhalo=(3.5+-1.2)E10 Msun and a small concentration of 2.0+-0.36.
AGC 242019 challenges alternatives of cold dark matter by constraining the
particle mass of fuzzy dark matter to be &lt; 0.11E-22 eV or &gt; 3.3E-22 eV , the
cross section of self-interacting dark matter to be &lt; 1.63 cm2/g, and the
particle mass of warm dark matter to be &gt; 0.23 keV, all of which are in tension
with other constraints. The modified Newtonian dynamics is also inconsistent
with a shallow radial acceleration relationship of AGC 242019. For the feedback
scenario that transforms a cusp to a core, AGC 242019 disagrees with the
stellar-to-halo-mass-ratio dependent model, but agrees with the
star-formation-threshold dependent model. As a UDG, AGC 242019 is in a
dwarf-size halo with weak stellar feedback, late formation time, a normal
baryonic spin and low star formation efficiency (SFR/gas).

histogram can be measured at different galaxy-cluster separations, this
observable is commonly referred to as the stacked phase-space density. We
formulate the stacked phase density based on a halo-model approach so that the
model can be applied to real samples of galaxies and clusters. We examine our
model by using an actual sample of massive clusters with known weak-lensing
masses and spectroscopic observations of galaxies around the clusters. A simple
likelihood analysis with our model enables us to infer the three-dimensional
velocity dispersion of observed galaxies in massive clusters. We find the
velocity bias of galaxies surrounding clusters with their masses of
$\sim10^{15}\, h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ to be $1.09\pm0.245$ at the 68\% confidence
level (including systematic errors associated with our model uncertainties).
Our results confirm that the relation between the galaxy velocity dispersion

dark-matter-only N-body simulations. We measure the line-of-sight velocity
dispersions of 16701 galaxies around 23 clusters on scales of $&lt;6\,

          <p>The anisotropy or triaxiality of massive dark matter haloes largely defines
the structure of the cosmic web, in particular the filaments that join the
haloes together. Here we investigate such oriented correlations in mass-Peak
Patch halo catalogues by using the initial strain tensor of spherical
proto-halo regions to orient the haloes. To go beyond the spherically averaged
two-point correlation function of haloes we use oriented stacks to compute
oriented two-point correlations: we explicitly break isotropy by imposing a
local frame set by the strain tensor of the reference halo before stacking
neighbouring haloes. Beyond the exclusion zone of the reference halo,
clustering is found to be strongly enhanced along the major direction of the
strain tensor as expected. This anisotropic clustering of haloes along
filaments is further quantified by using a spherical harmonics decomposition.
Furthermore, we compute the evolution of cluster-scale halo principal
directions relative to those of their neighbours and show that there are strong
correlations extending up to very large scales. In order to provide
calculations more suitable to observational confrontations, we also utilize 2D
projected versions of some equivalent correlation functions. Finally, we show
that the multipole structure of the mass-peak patch halo's anisotropic
clustering can be qualitatively captured in an analytic treatment based on peak
theory. Though highly informative, analytic evaluation involves extensive use
of Monte Carlo methods, which is also what the simulated catalogue uses, taking
into account as they do the adaptive nature of the mass-peak patch mass
hierarchy and all non-local complexities associated with the exclusion of
smaller haloes overlapping with larger ones: there is no substitute for the
mass-Peak Patch simulation-based determination of oriented and anisotropic
correlations.

          <p>In this study, we present an update of a compilation of line width
measurements of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) galaxy spectra at 21 cm
wavelength. Our All Digital HI (ADHI) catalog consists of the previous release
augmented with our new HI observations and an analysis of archival data. This
study provides the required HI information to measure the distances of spiral
galaxies through the application of the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation. We
conducted observations at the Green Bank telescope (GBT) and reprocessed
spectra obtained at the Nancay radiotelescope by the Nancay Interstellar
Baryons Legacy Extragalactic Survey (NIBLES) and Kinematics of the Local
Universe (KLUN) collaborations and we analyzed the recently published full
completion Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) 100% survey in order to identify
galaxies with good quality HI line width measurements. This paper adds new HI
data adequate for TF use for 385 galaxies observed at GBT, 889 galaxies from
archival Nancay spectra, and 1,515 rescaled Arecibo ALFALFA spectra. In total,
this release adds 1,274 new good quality measurements to the ADHI catalog.
Today, the ADHI database contains 18,874 galaxies, for which 15,433 have good
quality data for TF use. The final goal is to compute accurate distances to
spiral galaxies, which will be included in the next generation of peculiar
velocities catalog: Cosmicflows-4.

          <p>We present a new summary statistic for weak lensing observables, higher than
second order, suitable for extracting non-Gaussian cosmological information and
inferring cosmological parameters. We name this statistic the 'starlet
$\ell_1$-norm' as it is computed via the sum of the absolute values of the
starlet (wavelet) decomposition coefficients of a weak lensing map. In
comparison to the state-of-the-art higher-order statistics -- weak lensing peak
counts and minimum counts, or the combination of the two -- the $\ell_1$-norm
provides a fast multi-scale calculation of the full void and peak distribution,
avoiding the problem of defining what a peak is and what a void is: The
$\ell_1$-norm carries the information encoded in all pixels of the map, not
just the ones in local maxima and minima. We show its potential by applying it
to the weak lensing convergence maps provided by the MassiveNus simulations to
get constraints on the sum of neutrino masses, the matter density parameter,
and the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum. We find that, in an ideal
setting without further systematics, the starlet $\ell_1$-norm remarkably
outperforms commonly used summary statistics, such as the power spectrum or the
combination of peak and void counts, in terms of constraining power,
representing a promising new unified framework to simultaneously account for
the information encoded in peak counts and voids. We find that the starlet
$\ell_1$-norm outperforms the power spectrum by $72\%$ on M$_{\nu}$, $60\%$ on
$\Omega_{\rm m}$, and $75\%$ on $A_{\rm s}$ for the Euclid-like setting
considered; it also improves upon the state-of-the-art combination of peaks and
voids for a single smoothing scale by $24\%$ on M$_{\nu}$, $50\%$ on
$\Omega_{\rm m}$, and $24\%$ on $A_{\rm s}$.

          <p>Radio halos are synchrotron diffuse sources at the centre of a fraction of
galaxy clusters. The study of large samples of clusters with adequate radio and
X-ray data is necessary to investigate the origin of radio halos and their
connection with the cluster dynamics and formation history. The aim of this
paper is to compile a well-selected sample of galaxy clusters with deep radio
observations to perform an unbiased statistical study of the properties of
radio halos. We selected 75 clusters with M &gt; = 6e14 Msun at z=0.08-0.33 from
the Planck Sunyaev-Zel'dovich catalogue. Clusters without suitable radio data
were observed with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and/or the Jansky
Very Large Array (JVLA) to complete the information about the possible presence
of diffuse emission. We used archival Chandra X-ray data to derive information
on the clusters' dynamical states. This observational campaign led to the
detection of several cluster-scale diffuse radio sources and candidates that
deserve future follow-up observations. Here we summarise their properties and
add information resulting from our new observations. For the clusters where we
did not detect any hint of diffuse emission, we derived new upper limits to
their diffuse flux. We have built the largest mass-selected (&gt; 80 per cent
complete in mass) sample of galaxy clusters with deep radio observations
available to date. The statistical analysis of the sample, which includes the
connection between radio halos and cluster mergers, the radio power-mass
correlation, and the occurrence of radio halos as a function of the cluster
mass, will be presented in paper II.

          <p>Many galaxy clusters host Mpc scale diffuse radio sources called radio halos.
Their origin is connected to the processes that lead to the formation of
clusters themselves. In order to unveil this connection, statistical studies of
radio halos are necessary. We selected a sample of galaxy clusters with
M500&gt;6e14Msun and z=0.08-0.33 from the Planck SZ catalogue. In paper I, we
presented the radio and X-ray data analysis that we carried out on these
clusters. Here, we study the radio properties of the sample, in connection to
the mass and dynamical state of clusters. We used the dynamical information
derived from the X-ray data to assess the role of mergers in the origin of
radio halos. We studied the distribution of clusters in the radio power-mass
diagram and the role of dynamics on the radio luminosity and emissivity of
radio halos. We measured the occurrence of radio halos as a function of the
cluster mass and we compared it with the expectations of turbulent acceleration
models. We found that more than the 90% of radio halos are in merging clusters
and that their radio power correlates with the mass of the host clusters. The
correlation shows a large dispersion. Interestingly, we showed that cluster
dynamics contributes significantly to this dispersion with more disturbed
clusters being more radio luminous. Clusters without radio halos are generally
relaxed and the upper limits to their diffuse emission lie below the
correlation. We showed that the radio emissivity of clusters exhibits an
apparent bimodality, with the emissivity of radio halos being at least 5 times
larger than the non-emission associated with more relaxed clusters. We found
that the fraction of radio halos drops from ~70% in high mass clusters to ~35%
in the lower mass systems of the sample and we showed that this result is in
good agreement with the expectations from turbulent re-acceleration models.

          <p>We present measurements of the $E$-mode ($EE$) polarization power spectrum
and temperature-$E$-mode ($TE$) cross-power spectrum of the cosmic microwave
background using data collected by SPT-3G, the latest instrument installed on
the South Pole Telescope. This analysis uses observations of a 1500 deg$^2$
region at 95, 150, and 220 GHz taken over a four month period in 2018. We
report binned values of the $EE$ and $TE$ power spectra over the angular
multipole range $300 \le \ell &lt; 3000$, using the multifrequency data to
construct six semi-independent estimates of each power spectrum and their
minimum-variance combination. These measurements improve upon the previous
results of SPTpol across the multipole ranges $300 \le \ell \le 1400$ for $EE$
and $300 \le \ell \le 1700$ for $TE$, resulting in constraints on cosmological
parameters comparable to those from other current leading ground-based
experiments. We find that the SPT-3G dataset is well-fit by a $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological model with parameter constraints consistent with those from Planck
and SPTpol data. From SPT-3G data alone, we find $H_0 = 68.8 \pm 1.5
\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.789 \pm 0.016$, with a
gravitational lensing amplitude consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM prediction
($A_L = 0.98 \pm 0.12$). We combine the SPT-3G and the Planck datasets and
obtain joint constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model. The volume of the 68%
confidence region in six-dimensional $\Lambda$CDM parameter space is reduced by
a factor of 1.5 compared to Planck-only constraints, with only slight shifts in
central values. We note that the results presented here are obtained from data
collected during just half of a typical observing season with only part of the
focal plane operable, and that the active detector count has since nearly
doubled for observations made with SPT-3G after 2018.

          <p>Small-scale density fluctuations can significantly affect reionization, but
are typically modelled quite crudely. Unresolved fluctuations in numerical
simulations and analytical calculations are included using a gas
\textit{clumping factor}, typically assumed to be independent of the local
environment. In \cite{Mao2019} (Paper I) we presented an improved, local
density-dependent model for the sub-grid gas clumping. Here we extend this
using an \textit{empirical stochastic model} based on the results from
high-resolution numerical simulations which fully resolve all relevant
fluctuations. Our model reproduces well both the mean density-clumping relation
and its scatter. We applied our stochastic model, along with the mean clumping
one and the Paper I deterministic model, to create a large-volume realisations
of the clumping field, and used these in radiative transfer simulations of
cosmic reionization. Our results show that the simplistic mean clumping model
delays reionization compared to local density-dependent models, despite
producing fewer recombinations overall. This is due to the very different
spatial distribution of clumping, resulting in much higher photoionization
rates in the latter cases. The mean clumping model produces smaller H~II
regions throughout most of reionization, but those percolate faster at late
times. It also causes significant delay in the 21-cm fluctuations peak and
yields lower non-Gaussianity and many fewer bright pixels in the PDF
distribution. The stochastic density-dependent model shows relatively minor
differences from the deterministic one, mostly concentrated around overlap,
where it significantly suppresses the 21-cm fluctuations, and at the bright
tail of the 21-cm PDFs, where it produces noticeably more bright pixels.

          <p>Massive neutrinos influence the background evolution of the Universe as well
as the growth of structure. Being able to model this effect and constrain the
sum of their masses is one of the key challenges in modern cosmology.
Weak-lensing cosmological constraints will also soon reach higher levels of
precision with next-generation surveys like LSST, WFIRST and Euclid. We use the
MassiveNus simulations to derive constraints on the sum of neutrino masses
$M_{\nu}$, the present-day total matter density $\Omega_{\rm m}$, and the
primordial power spectrum normalization $A_{\rm s}$ in a tomographic setting.
We measure the lensing power spectrum as second-order statistics along with
peak counts as higher-order statistics on lensing convergence maps generated
from the simulations. We investigate the impact of multiscale filtering
approaches on cosmological parameters by employing a starlet (wavelet) filter
and a concatenation of Gaussian filters. In both cases peak counts perform
better than the power spectrum on the set of parameters [$M_{\nu}$,
$\Omega_{\rm m}$, $A_{\rm s}$] respectively by 63$\%$, 40$\%$ and 72$\%$ when
using a starlet filter and by 70$\%$, 40$\%$ and 77$\%$ when using a multiscale
Gaussian. More importantly, we show that when using a multiscale approach,
joining power spectrum and peaks does not add any relevant information over
considering just the peaks alone. While both multiscale filters behave
similarly, we find that with the starlet filter the majority of the information
in the data covariance matrix is encoded in the diagonal elements; this can be
an advantage when inverting the matrix, speeding up the numerical
implementation.

a significant contribution signaled by flavor-nonuniversal quark condensates at

remarkable flavor breaking in the axial anomaly as well as the QCD theta vacuum

          <p>The search for primordial gravitational waves through the $B$-mode
polarization pattern in the CMB is one of the major goals of current and future
CMB experiments. Besides foregrounds, a potential hurdle in this search is the
anisotropic secondary $B$-mode polarization generated by the scattering of CMB
photons off free electrons produced during patchy cosmological reionization.
Robust predictions of these secondary anisotropies are challenging because of
uncertainties in the reionization history. In this paper, we revise estimates
of the reionization-induced $B$-mode signal by incorporating recent advances in
the understanding of reionization through observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$
forest. To derive these $B$-mode estimates, we use high-dynamic-range radiative
transfer simulations of reionization that are calibrated to the Ly$\alpha$
data. These simulations are also consistent with a variety of other
high-redshift observations. We find that around multipoles $\ell\approx 100$,
reionization induces $B$-mode power with $\ell(\ell+1)C_\ell^{BB}/2\pi\approx
4\times 10^{-6}\,\mu$K$^2$. This secondary signal is thus at the level of the
primordial signal with the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r&lt;10^{-4}$, and can increase
by a factor of $\sim 50$ if reionization is sourced by highly clustered sources
residing in haloes with mass of $\sim 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$. Our findings suggest
that the contribution of patchy reionization to the search for primordial
gravitational waves is unlikely to be a concern for currently planned CMB
experiments.

included) and the galaxy cluster (baryonic and dark) matter distribution using
a sample of 528 clusters at $0.2\leq z \leq 0.35$ found in the Dark Energy
Survey (DES) Year 1 data. The surface brightness of the diffuse light shows an
increasing dependence on cluster total mass at larger radius, and appears to be
self-similar with a universal radial dependence after scaling by cluster
radius. We also compare the diffuse light radial profiles to the cluster
(baryonic and dark) matter distribution measured through weak lensing and find
them to be comparable. The IllustrisTNG galaxy formation simulation, TNG300,
offers further insight into the connection between diffuse stellar mass and
cluster matter distributions -- the simulation radial profile of the diffuse
stellar component does not have a similar slope with the total cluster matter
content, although that of the cluster satellite galaxies does. Regardless of
the radial trends, the amount of diffuse stellar mass has a low-scatter scaling
relation with cluster's total mass in the simulation, out-performing the total
stellar mass of cluster satellite galaxies. We conclude that there is no
consistent evidence yet on whether or not diffuse light is a faithful radial
tracer of the cluster matter distribution. Nevertheless, both observational and
simulation results reveal that diffuse light is an excellent indicator of the
cluster's total mass.

          <p>These lecture notes are based on a course given by Mark Hindmarsh at the 24th
Saalburg Summer School 2018 and written up by Marvin L\"uben, Johannes Lumma
and Martin Pauly. The aim is to provide the necessary basics to understand
first-order phase transitions in the early universe, to outline how they leave
imprints in gravitational waves, and advertise how those gravitational waves
could be detected in the future. A first-order phase transition at the
electroweak scale is a prediction of many theories beyond the Standard Model,
and is also motivated as an ingredient of some theories attempting to provide
an explanation for the matter-antimatter asymmetry in our Universe.
</p>
<p>Starting from bosonic and fermionic statistics, we derive Boltzmann's
equation and generalise to a fluid of particles with field dependent mass. We
introduce the thermal effective potential for the field in its lowest order
approximation, discuss the transition to the Higgs phase in the Standard Model
and beyond, and compute the probability for the field to cross a potential
barrier. After these preliminaries, we provide a hydrodynamical description of
first-order phase transitions as it is appropriate for describing the early
Universe. We thereby discuss the key quantities characterising a phase
transition, and how they are imprinted in the gravitational wave power spectrum
that might be detectable by the space-based gravitational wave detector LISA in
the 2030s.

          <p>We assess the performance of the multipole expansion formalism in the case of
single-dish HI intensity mapping, including instrumental and foreground removal
effects. This formalism is used to provide MCMC forecasts for a range of HI and
cosmological parameters, including redshift space distortions and the
Alcock-Paczynski effect. We first determine the range of validity of our power
spectrum modelling by fitting to simulation data, concentrating on the
monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole contributions. We then show that
foreground subtraction effects can lead to severe biases in the determination
of cosmological parameters, in particular the parameters relating to the
transverse BAO rescaling, the growth rate and the HI bias ($\alpha_\perp$,
$\overline{T}_\text{HI} f\sigma_8$, and $\overline{T}_\text{HI} b_\text{HI}
\sigma_8$, respectively). We attempt to account for these biases by
constructing a 2-parameter foreground modelling prescription, and find that our
prescription leads to unbiased parameter estimation at the expense of
increasing the estimated uncertainties on cosmological parameters. In addition,
we confirm that instrumental and foreground removal effects significantly
impact the theoretical covariance matrix, and cause the covariance between
different multipoles to become non-negligible. Finally, we show the effect of
including higher-order multipoles in our analysis, and how these can be used to
investigate the presence of instrumental and systematic effects in HI intensity
mapping data.

          <p>Galaxy clustering is a standard cosmological probe that is commonly analysed
through two-point statistics. In observations, the estimation of the two-point
correlation function crucially relies on counting pairs in a random catalogue.
The latter contains a large number of randomly distributed points, which
accounts for the survey window function. Random pair counts can also be
advantageously used for modelling the window function in the observed power
spectrum. Since pair counting scales as $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, where $N$ is the
number of points, the computational time to measure random pair counts can be
very expensive for large surveys. In this work, we present an alternative
approach for estimating those counts that does not rely on the use of a random
catalogue. We derived an analytical expression for the anisotropic
random-random pair counts that accounts for the galaxy radial distance
distribution, survey geometry, and possible galaxy weights.
</p>
<p>Considering the cases of the VIPERS and SDSS-BOSS redshift surveys, we find
that the analytical calculation is in excellent agreement with the pair counts
obtained from random catalogues. The main advantage of this approach is that
the primary calculation only takes a few minutes on a single CPU and it does
not depend on the number of random points. Furthermore, it allows for an
accuracy on the monopole equivalent to what we would otherwise obtain when
using a random catalogue with about 1500 times more points than in the data at
hand. We also describe and test an approximate expression for data-random pair
counts that is less accurate than for random-random counts, but still provides
subpercent accuracy on the monopole. The presented formalism should be very
useful in accounting for the window function in next-generation surveys, which
will necessitate accurate two-point window function estimates over huge
observed cosmological volumes.

          <p>Galaxy bispectrum is a promising probe of inflationary physics in the early
universe as a measure of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), whereas its
signal-to-noise ratio is significantly affected by the mode coupling due to
non-linear gravitational growth. In this paper, we examine the standard
reconstruction method of linear cosmic mass density fields from non-linear
galaxy density fields to de-correlate the covariance in redshift-space galaxy
bispectra. In particular, we evaluate the covariance of the bispectrum for
massive-galaxy-sized dark matter halos with reconstruction by using 4000
independent $N$-body simulations. Our results show that the bispectrum
covariance for the post-reconstructed field approaches the Gaussian prediction
at scale of $k&lt;0.2\, h\, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We also verify the leading-order
PNG-induced bispectrum is not affected by details of the reconstruction with
perturbative theory. We then demonstrate the constraining power of the
post-reconstructed bispectrum for PNG at redshift of $\sim0.5$. Further, we
perform a Fisher analysis to make a forecast of PNG constraints by galaxy
bispectra including anisotropic signals. Assuming a massive galaxy sample in
the SDSS Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, we find that the
post-reconstructed bispectrum can constrain the local-, equilateral- and
orthogonal-types of PNG with $\Delta f_{\rm NL} \sim$13, 90 and 42,
respectively, improving the constraints with the pre-reconstructed bispectrum
by a factor of $1.3-3.2$. In conclusion, the reconstruction plays an essential
role in constraining various types of PNG signatures with a level of $\Delta
f_{\rm NL}&lt;1$ from the galaxy bispectrum based on upcoming galaxy surveys.

          <p>We have used the recently published varying physical constants (VPC) approach
to resolve the primordial lithium abundance problem. The value of the ratio of
7Li to hydrogen $7Li/H=1.400(+-0.023){\times}10^{-10}$ we have calculated using
this approach is about four times lower than that estimated using the standard
lambda cold dark matter (${\Lambda}$CDM) cosmological model, and is consistent
with the most agreed observational value of $1.6(+-0.3){\times}10^{-10}$. In
the VPC approach Einstein equations are modified to include the variation of
the speed of light $c$, gravitational constant $G$ and cosmological constant
${\Lambda}$ using the Einstein-Hilbert action. Application of this approach to
cosmology naturally leads to the variation of the Plank constant $h$ and the
Boltzmann constant $k_B$ as well. They approach fixed values at the scale
factor a&lt;&lt;1: $c=c_0/e$, $G=G_0/e^3$, $h=h_0/e$ and $k_B=k_{B0}/e^{5/4}$, where
$e$ is the Euler's number (=2.7183). Since the VPC cosmology reduces to the
same form as the ${\Lambda}$CDM cosmology at very small scale factors, we could
use an existing Big-Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) code AlterBBN with the above
changes to calculate the light element abundances under the VPC cosmology.
Among other abundances we have calculated at baryon to photon ratio
${\eta}=6.1{\times}10^{-10}$ are: $4He/H =0.2478 (+-0.041)$, $D/H

          <p>The well-developed separate universe technique enables accurate calibration
of the response of any observable to an isotropic long-wavelength density
fluctuation. The large-scale environment also hosts tidal modes that perturb
all observables anisotropically. As in the separate universe, both the long
tidal and density modes can be absorbed by an effective anisotropic background,
on which the interaction and evolution of the short modes change accordingly.
We further develop the tidal simulation method, including proper corrections to
the second order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT) to generate initial
conditions of the simulations. We measure the linear tidal responses of the
matter power spectrum, at high redshift from our modified 2LPT, and at low
redshift from the tidal simulations. Our results agree qualitatively with
previous works, but exhibit quantitative differences in both cases. We also
measure the linear tidal response of the halo shapes, or the shape bias, and
find its universal relation with the linear halo bias, for which we provide a
fitting formula. Furthermore, analogous to the assembly bias, we study the
secondary dependence of the shape bias, and discover for the first time
dependence on halo concentration and axis ratio. Our results provide useful
insights for studies of the intrinsic alignment as source of either
contamination or information. These effects need to be correctly taken into
account when one uses intrinsic alignments of galaxy shapes as a precision
cosmological tool.

the early Universe and show that the stochastic gravitational wave (GW)
background produced by this system may be probed by future GW experiments
across a vast range of frequencies. The numerical simulation on the lattice
allows us to take into account non-linear backreaction effects and enables us
to accurately predict the final relic abundance of the axion or axion-like
particle (ALP) as well as its inhomogeneities, and gives a more precise
prediction of the GW spectrum. Importantly, we find that the GW spectrum has
more power at high momenta due to $2\rightarrow1$ processes. Furthermore, we
find the degree of polarization of the peak of the GW spectrum depends on the
ALP-dark photon coupling and that the polarization can be washed out or even
flipped for large values thereof. In line with recent results in the
literature, we find the ALP relic abundance may be suppressed by two orders of
magnitude and discuss possible extensions of the model that expand the viable
parameter space. Finally, we discuss the possibility to probe ultralight ALP
dark matter via spectral distortions of the CMB.

          <p>Alternative theories of gravity predict modifications in the propagation of
gravitational waves (GW) through space-time. One of the smoking-gun predictions
of such theories is the change in the GW luminosity distance to GW sources as a
function of redshift relative to the electromagnetic (EM) luminosity distance
expected from EM probes. We propose a multi-messenger test of the theory of
general relativity from the propagation of gravitational waves by combining EM
and GW observations to resolve these issues from GW sources without EM
counterparts (which are also referred to as dark standard sirens). By using the
relation between the geometric distances accessible from baryon acoustic
oscillation measurements, and luminosity distance measurements from the GW
sources, we can measure any deviation from the general theory of relativity via
the GW sources of unknown redshift that will be detectable by networks of GW
detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. Using this technique, the fiducial
value of the frictional term can be measured to a precision
$\Xi_0=0.98^{+0.04}_{-0.23}$ after marginalizing over redshift dependence,
cosmological parameters, and GW bias parameters with $\sim 3500$ dark standard
sirens of masses $30\,\rm M_\odot$ each distributed up to redshift $z=0.5$. For
a fixed redshift dependence, a value of $\Xi_0=0.99^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ can be
measured with a similar number of dark sirens. Application of our methodology
to the far more numerous dark standard sirens detectable with next generation
GW detectors, such as LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will allow
achievement of higher accuracy than possible from use of bright standard
sirens.

          <p>In Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, all observers measure the speed
of light, $c$, to be the same. However, this refers to the round trip speed,
where a clock at the origin times the outward and return trip of light
reflecting off a distant mirror. Measuring the one-way speed of light is
fraught with issues of clock synchronisation, and, as long as the average speed
of light remains $c$, the speeds on the outward and return legs could be
different. One objection to this anisotropic speed of light is that views of
the distant universe would be different in different directions, especially
with regards to the ages of observed objects and the smoothness of the Cosmic
Microwave Background. In this paper, we explore this in the Milne universe, the
limiting case of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe containing no matter,
radiation or dark energy. Given that this universe is empty, it can be mapped
onto flat Minkowski space-time, and so can be explored in terms of the one-way
speed of light. The conclusion is that the presence of an anisotropic speed of
light leads to anisotropic time dilation effects, and hence observers in the
Milne universe would be presented with an isotropic view of the distant cosmos.
