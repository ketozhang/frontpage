          <p>The anomalous 21 cm absorption feature reported by EDGES has galvanized the
study of scenarios in which dark matter (DM) siphons off thermal energy from
the Standard Model (SM) gas. In a departure from the much-discussed models that
achieve cooling by DM scattering directly with SM particles, we show that the
same end can be achieved through neutral atomic hydrogen $H$ mixing with a
degenerate dark sector state $H'$. An analysis of in-medium $H$-$H'$
oscillations reveals viable parameter space for generic types of $H'$-DM
interactions to provide the requisite cooling. This strategy stands in stark
contrast to other proposals in many respects, including its cosmological
dynamics, model building implications, and complementary observational
signatures.

          <p>Models of the reionization and reheating of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at
redshifts $z \gtrsim 6$ continue to grow more sophisticated in anticipation of
near-future datasets from 21-cm, cosmic microwave background, and galaxy survey
measurements. Though a relatively simple picture of high-$z$ galaxy evolution
has emerged in recent years that should be well constrained by upcoming
observations, there are many potential sources of systematic uncertainty in
models that could bias and/or degrade these constraints if left unaccounted
for. In this work, we examine three commonly-ignored sources of uncertainty in
models for the mean reionization and thermal histories of the IGM: the
underlying cosmology, the halo mass function (HMF), and the choice of stellar
population synthesis (SPS) model. We find that cosmological uncertainties are
small, affecting the Thomson scattering optical depth at the few percent level
and the amplitude of the global 21-cm signal at the $\sim$few mK level. The
differences brought about by choice of HMF and SPS models are more dramatic,
comparable to the $1 \sigma$ error-bar on $\tau_e$ and a $\sim 20$ mK effect on
the global 21-cm signal amplitude. We compare models with comparable empirical
predictions by jointly fitting galaxy luminosity functions and global 21-cm
signals, and find that (i) doing so requires additional free parameters to
compensate for modeling systematics and (ii) the spread in constraints on
parameters of interest for different HMF and SPS choices, assuming $5$ mK noise
in the global signal, is comparable to those obtained when adopting the "true"
HMF and SPS with $\gtrsim 20$ mK errors. Our work highlights the need for
dedicated efforts to reduce the uncertainties in common modeling ingredients in
order to enable precision inference with future datasets.

          <p>Hydrogen oscillation into a dark-sector state $H'$ has recently been proposed
as a novel mechanism through which hydrogen can be cooled during the dark ages
-- without direct couplings between the Standard Model and dark matter. In this
work we demonstrate that the requisite mixing can appear naturally from a
microphysical theory, and argue that the startling deviations from standard
cosmology are nonetheless consistent with observations. A symmetric mirror
model enforces the necessary degeneracy between $H$ and $H'$, and an additional
twisted $B+L'$ symmetry dictates that $H$-$H'$ mixing is the leading connection
between the sectors. We write down a UV completion where $\sim$ TeV-scale
leptoquarks generate the partonic dimension-12 mixing operator, thus linking to
the energy frontier. With half of all $H$ atoms oscillating into $H'$, the
composition of the universe is scandalously different during part of its
history. We qualitatively discuss structure formation: both the modifications
to it in the Standard Model sector and the possibility of it in the mirror
sector, which has recently been proposed as a resolution to the puzzle of early
supermassive black holes. While the egregious loss of SM baryons mostly
self-erases during reionization, to our knowledge this is the first model that
suggests there should be missing baryons in the late universe, and highly
motivates a continued, robust observational program of high-precision searches
for cosmic baryons.

          <p>We develop an extension of subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) capable of
accurately reproducing the real and redshift-space clustering of galaxies in a
state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulation. Our method uses a low-resolution
gravity-only simulation and it includes orphan and tidal disruption
prescriptions for satellite galaxies, and a flexible amount of galaxy assembly
bias. Furthermore, it includes recipes for star formation rate (SFR) based on
the dark matter accretion rate. We test the accuracy of our model against
catalogues of stellar-mass- and SFR-selected galaxies in the TNG300
hydrodynamic simulation. By fitting a small number of free parameters, our
extended SHAM reproduces the projected correlation function and redshift-space
multipoles for number densities $10^{-3} - 10^{-2}\, h^{3}{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$, at
$z=1$ and $z=0$, and for scales $r \in [0.3 - 20] h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$.
Simultaneously, the SHAM results also retrieve the correct halo occupation
distribution, the level of galaxy assembly bias, and higher-order statistics
present in the TNG300 galaxy catalogues. As an application, we show that our
model simultaneously fits the projected correlation function of the SDSS in 3
disjoint stellar mass bins, with an accuracy similar to that of TNG300
galaxies. This SHAM extension can be used to get accurate clustering prediction
even when using low and moderate-resolution simulations.

to a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model, which allows us to constrain
the self-interaction cross section. When our full method is applied to mock
data generated from two clusters in the Illustris-TNG simulation, we find
results consistent with no dark matter self-interactions as expected. For the
eight observed clusters with maximum circular velocities in the range of 1400

          <p>This paper investigates the hierarchy of baryon physics assembly bias
relations obtained from state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations with respect
to the underlying cosmic web spanned by the dark matter field. Using the Bias
Assignment Method (BAM) we find that non-local bias plays a central role. We
classify the cosmic web based on the invariants of the curvature tensor defined
not only by the gravitational potential, but especially by the overdensity, as
small scale clustering becomes important in this context. First, the gas
density bias relation can be directly mapped onto the dark matter density field
to high precision exploiting the strong correlation between them. In a second
step, the neutral hydrogen is mapped based on the dark matter and the gas
density fields. Finally, the temperature is mapped based on the previous
quantities. This permits us to statistically reconstruct the baryon properties
within the same simulated volume finding percent-precision in the two-point
statistics and compatible results in the three-point statistics, in general
within 1-$\sigma$, with respect to the reference simulation (with 5 to 6 orders
of magnitude less computing time). This paves the path to establish the best
set-up for the construction of mocks probing the intergalactic medium for the
generation of such key ingredients in the statistical analysis of large

          <p>Curiously, our Universe was born in a low entropy state, with abundant free
energy to power stars and life. The form that this free energy takes is usually
thought to be gravitational: the Universe is almost perfectly smooth, and so
can produce sources of energy as matter collapses under gravity. It has
recently been argued that a more important source of low-entropy energy is
nuclear: the Universe expands too fast to remain in nuclear statistical
equilibrium (NSE), effectively shutting off nucleosynthesis in the first few
minutes, providing leftover hydrogen as fuel for stars. Here, we fill in the
astrophysical details of this scenario, and seek the conditions under which a
Universe will emerge from early nucleosynthesis as almost-purely iron. In so
doing, we identify a hitherto-overlooked character in the story of the origin
of the second law: matter-antimatter asymmetry.

          <p>The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) with the Vera Rubin Observatory
will provide strong microlensing constraints on dark compact objects (DCOs) in
our Galaxy. However, most current forecasts limit their analysis to Primordial
Black Holes (PBH) as the primary DCO candidate. Thus, it is unclear how well
LSST microlensing will be able to constrain alternative models of DCOs which
may possess different galactic spatial profile distributions at a subdominant
DM fraction. In this work, we investigate how well LSST microlensing will
constrain spherical or disk-like galactic spatial distributions of DCOs, taking
into account the effects of extended observing times, baryonic microlensing
background, and sky distribution of LSST sources. These extensions represent
significant improvements over existing microlensing forecasts for LSST in terms
of both accuracy and versatility. We demonstrate this power by deriving new
LSST sensitivity projections for DCOs in spherical and disk-like distributions.
We forecast that LSST will be able to constrain PBHs with one solar mass to
have a DM fraction under $1.6\times10^{-4}$. One-solar-mass objects in a dark
disk distribution with the same dimensions as the Galactic disk will be
constrained below $1.4\times10^{-4}$, while those with $m = 10^5 M_{\odot}$
will be constrained to below $9.3\times10^{-6}$. We find that compressed dark
disks can be constrained up to a factor of $\sim10$ better than ones with
identical dimensions to the baryonic disk. We also find that dark disks become
less tightly constrained when they are tilted with respect to our own disk.
This forecasting software is a versatile tool, capable of constraining any
model of DCOs in the Milky Way with microlensing, and is made publically
available at {https://github.com/HarrisonWinch96/DarkDisk_Microlensing}.

          <p>We explore relativistic freeze-in production of scalar dark matter in gauged
$B-L$ model, where we focus on the production of dark matter from the decay and
annihilation of Standard Model (SM) and $B-L$ Higgs bosons. We consider the
Bose-Einstein (BE) and Fermi-Dirac (FD) statistics, along with the thermal mass
correction of the SM Higgs boson in our analysis. We show that in addition to
the SM Higgs boson, the annihilation and decay of the $B-L$ scalar can also
contribute substantially to the dark matter relic density. Potential effects of
electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and thermal mass correction in BE
framework enhance the dark matter relic substantially as it freezes-in near
EWSB temperature via scalar annihilation. However, such effects are not so
prominent when the dark matter freezes-in at a later epoch than EWSB,
dominantly by decay of scalars. The results of this analysis are rather
generic, and applicable to other similar scenarios.

          <p>This paper seeks to test if the large-scale galaxy distribution can be
characterized as a fractal system. Tools appropriate for describing galaxy
fractal structures with a single fractal dimension $D$ in relativistic settings
are developed and applied to the UltraVISTA galaxy survey. A graph of
volume-limited samples corresponding to the redshift limits in each redshift
bins for absolute magnitude is presented. Fractal analysis using the standard
$\Lambda$CDM cosmological model is applied to a reduced subsample in the range
$0.1\le z \le 4$, and the entire sample within $0.1\le z\le 6$. Three
relativistic distances are used, the luminosity distance $d_L$, redshift
distance $d_z$ and galaxy area distance $d_G$, because for data at $z\gtrsim
0.3$ relativistic effects are such that for the same $z$ these distance
definitions yield different values. The results show two consecutive and
distinct redshift ranges in both the reduced and complete samples where the
data behave as a single fractal galaxy structure. For the reduced subsample we
found that the fractal dimension is $D=\left(1.58\pm0.20\right)$ for $z&lt;1$, and
$D=\left(0.59\pm0.28\right)$ for $1\le z\le 4$. The complete sample yielded
$D=\left(1.63\pm0.20\right)$ for $z&lt;1$ and $D=\left(0.52\pm0.29\right)$ for
$1\le z\le6$. These results are consistent with those found by Conde-Saavedra
et al. (2015; <a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1409.5409">arXiv:1409.5409v1</a>), where a similar analysis was applied to a
much more limited survey at equivalent redshift depths, and suggest that either
there are yet unclear observational biases causing such decrease in the fractal
dimension, or the galaxy clustering was possibly more sparse and the universe
void dominated in a not too distant past.

          <p>The analysis of current and future cosmological surveys of type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia) at high-redshift depends on the accurate photometric classification of
the SN events detected. Generating realistic simulations of photometric SN
surveys constitutes an essential step for training and testing photometric
classification algorithms, and for correcting biases introduced by selection
effects and contamination arising from core collapse SNe in the photometric SN
Ia samples. We use published SN time-series spectrophotometric templates,
rates, luminosity functions and empirical relationships between SNe and their
host galaxies to construct a framework for simulating photometric SN surveys.
We present this framework in the context of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5-year
photometric SN sample, comparing our simulations of DES with the observed DES
transient populations. We demonstrate excellent agreement in many
distributions, including Hubble residuals, between our simulations and data. We
estimate the core collapse fraction expected in the DES SN sample after
selection requirements are applied and before photometric classification. After
testing different modelling choices and astrophysical assumptions underlying
our simulation, we find that the predicted contamination varies from 5.8 to 9.3
per cent, with an average of 7.0 per cent and r.m.s. of 1.1 per cent. Our
simulations are the first to reproduce the observed photometric SN and host
galaxy properties in high-redshift surveys without fine-tuning the input
parameters. The simulation methods presented here will be a critical component
of the cosmology analysis of the DES photometric SN Ia sample: correcting for
biases arising from contamination, and evaluating the associated systematic
uncertainty.

          <p>A broad excess of keV electron recoil events was reported by XENON1T
recently. This excess may be induced by the scattering of electrons and
long-lived MeV particles with high-speed. The properties of the new long-lived
particles are restricted by the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and cosmic
microwave background (CMB). Here we consider a tangible model of two scalar MeV
dark matter (DM) particles $S_A$ and $S_B$ to interpret the XENON1T keV excess
via boosted $S_B$. A small mass splitting $m_{S_A}-m_{S_B}&gt;0$ is introduced and
pairs of boosted $S_B S_B^\ast$ can be produced by the dark annihilation
process of $S_A S_A^\ast\to \phi \to S_B S_B^\ast$ via a resonant scalar
$\phi$. The $S_B-$electron scattering is intermediated by a vector boson $X$
which may cause the anomalous transitions of $^8$Be and $^4$He. Although
constraints from BBN, CMB and low-energy experiments set the $X-$mediated
$S_B-$electron scattering cross section to be $\lesssim 10^{-35}
\mathrm{cm}^2$, the MeV scale DM with an enhanced dark annihilation today can
still provide enough boosted $S_B S_B^\ast$ and induce the XENON1T keV excess.
The relic density of $S_B S_B^\ast$ is significantly reduced by the $s-$wave
process of $S_B S_B^\ast \to X X$ which is allowed by constraints from CMB and
21-cm absorption. A very small relic fraction of $S_B S_B^\ast$ is compatible
with the stringent bounds on un-boosted $S_B$-electron scattering in DM direct
detection and the un-boosted $S_A$-electron scattering is also allowed by the
direct detection.

convergence maps at arbitrary source redshifts with unprecedented precision.
MADLens is designed to achieve high accuracy while keeping computational costs
as low as possible. A MADLens simulation with only $256^3$ particles produces
convergence maps whose power agree with theoretical lensing power spectra up to
$L{=}10000$ within the accuracy limits of HaloFit. This is made possible by a
combination of a highly parallelizable particle-mesh algorithm, a sub-evolution
scheme in the lensing projection, and a machine-learning inspired sharpening
step. Further, MADLens is fully differentiable with respect to the initial
conditions of the underlying particle-mesh simulations and a number of
cosmological parameters. These properties allow MADLens to be used as a forward
model in Bayesian inference algorithms that require optimization or
derivative-aided sampling. Another use case for MADLens is the production of
large, high resolution simulation sets as they are required for training novel
deep-learning-based lensing analysis tools. We make the MADLens package

          <p>Spectral distortions (SDs) of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide a
powerful tool for studying particle physics. Here we compute the distortion
signals from decaying particles that convert directly into photons at different
epochs during cosmic history, focusing on injection energies
$E_\mathrm{inj}\lesssim 20\,\mathrm{keV}$. We deliver a comprehensive library
of SD solutions that can be used to study a wide range of particle physics
scenarios. We use {\tt CosmoTherm} to compute the SD signals, including effects
on the ionization history and opacities of the Universe. We also consider the
effect of blackbody-induced stimulated decay, which can modify the injection
history significantly. Then, we use data from COBE/FIRAS and EDGES to constrain
the properties of the decaying particles. We explore scenarios where these
provide a dark matter (DM) candidate or constitute only a small fraction of DM.
We complement the SD constraints with CMB anisotropy constraints, highlighting
new effects from injections at very-low photon energies ($h\nu\lesssim
10^{-4}\,\mathrm{eV}$). Our model-independent constraints exhibit rich
structures in the lifetime-energy domain, covering injection energies
$E_\mathrm{inj}\simeq 10^{-10}\mathrm{eV}-10\mathrm{keV}$ and lifetimes
$\tau_X\simeq 10^5\,\mathrm{s}-10^{33}\mathrm{s}$. We discuss the constraints
on axions and axion-like particles that convert directly into two photons,
revising existing SD constraints in the literature. Our limits are competitive
with other constraints for axion masses $m_a c^2\gtrsim 27\,\mathrm{eV}$ and we
find that simple estimates based on the overall energetics are generally
inaccurate. Future CMB spectrometers could significantly improve the obtained
constraints, thus providing an important complementary probe of early-universe
particle physics.

          <p>In this paper we study a model of interacting dark energy -- dark matter
where the ratio between these components is supposed to change from early to
late times in such a way that the model can solve or alleviate the cosmic
coincidence problem (CP). The interaction arises from an assumed relation
$\rho_x\propto\rho_d^\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is a free parameter. For a dark
energy equation of state parameter $\omega=-1$, if $\alpha=0$, the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model is recovered, where the coincidence problem is unsolved. For
$0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, the CP would be alleviated and for $\alpha\sim1$, the CP would be
solved. The dark energy component is analyzed both with $\omega=-1$ and
$\omega\neq -1$ equation of state parameter. In the case of $\omega=-1$, from
SNe Ia+$H(z)$ data constraints, we found $\alpha=0.109^{+0.062}_{-0.072}$ at
68\% c.l. and the CP is alleviated. For $\omega\neq-1$, a degeneracy arises on
the $\omega$ -- $\alpha$ plane, we added cosmic microwave background distance
priors and BAO to the constraints, which yielded $\alpha=-0.075\pm0.046$ at
68\% c.l. and the CP is not alleviated even for 2$\sigma$ superior limit for
$\alpha$.

          <p>We study the effects of ultralight vector field (ULVF) dark matter on
gravitational wave propagation. We find that the coherent oscillations of the
vector field induce an anisotropic suppression of the gravitational wave
amplitude as compared to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction. The effect is enhanced
for smaller vector field masses and peaks for modes around
$k=H_0/\sqrt{a(H=m)}$. The suppression is negligible for astrophysically
generated gravitational waves but could be sizeable for primordial gravity
waves. We discuss the possibility of detecting such an effect on the CMB B-mode

self-interactions mediated by a heavy scalar. Based on the latest CMB data from
the Planck 2018 data release as well as auxiliary data we confirm the presence
of a region in parameter space with relatively strong self-interactions which
provides a better than naively expected fit. However, we also find that the
most recent data, in particular high-$\ell$ polarisation data from the Planck

Our analysis takes into account finite neutrino masses (parameterised in terms
of $\sum m_{\nu}$) and allows for a varying neutrino energy density
(parameterised in terms of $N_{\rm eff}$), and we find that in all cases the
neutrino mass bound inferred from cosmological data is robust against the
presence of neutrino self-interactions. Finally, we also find that the strong
neutrino self-interactions do not lead to a high value of $H_0$ being
preferred, i.e. this model is not a viable solution to the current $H_0$

          <p>Pinning down the total neutrino mass and the dark energy equation of state is
a key aim for upcoming galaxy surveys. Weak lensing is a unique probe of the
total matter distribution whose non-Gaussian statistics can be quantified by
the one-point probability distribution function (PDF) of the lensing
convergence. We calculate the convergence PDF on mildly non-linear scales from
first principles using large-deviation statistics, accounting for dark energy
and the total neutrino mass. For the first time, we comprehensively validate
the cosmology-dependence of the convergence PDF model against large suites of
simulated lensing maps, demonstrating its percent-level precision and accuracy.
We show that fast simulation codes can provide highly accurate covariance
matrices, which can be combined with the theoretical PDF model to perform
forecasts and eliminate the need for relying on expensive N-body simulations.
Our theoretical model allows us to perform the first forecast for the
convergence PDF that varies the full set of $\Lambda$CDM parameters. Our Fisher
forecasts establish that the constraining power of the convergence PDF compares
favourably to the two-point correlation function for a Euclid-like survey area
at a single source redshift. When combined with a CMB prior from Planck, the
PDF constrains both the neutrino mass $M_\nu$ and the dark energy equation of
state $w_0$ more strongly than the two-point correlation function.

          <p>The interpretation of cosmological observations relies on a notion of average
Universe, which is usually taken as the homogeneous and isotropic
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model.
</p>
<p>However, inhomogeneities may statistically bias the observational averages
with respect to FLRW, notably for distance measurements, due to a number of
effects such as gravitational lensing and redshift perturbations.
</p>
<p>In this article, we review the main known theoretical results on average
distance measures in cosmology, based on second-order perturbation theory, and
fill some of their gaps. We then comprehensively test these theoretical
predictions against ray tracing in a high-resolution dark-matter $N$-body
simulation. This method allows us to describe the effect of small-scale
inhomogeneities deep into the non-linear regime of structure formation, on
light propagation up to $z=10$.
</p>
<p>We find that numerical results are in remarkably good agreement with
theoretical predictions, in the limit of super-sample variance. No unexpectedly
large bias originates from the very small scales, whose effect is fully encoded
in the non-linear power spectrum. Specifically, the directional average of the
inverse amplification and the source-averaged amplification are compatible with
unity; the change in area of surfaces of constant cosmic time is compatible
with zero; the biases on other distance measures, which can reach $\sim
10^{-3}$ at high redshift, are well understood. As a side product, we also
confront the predictions of the recent finite-beam formalism with numerical
data, and find excellent agreement.

to reduce systematic uncertainties. Characterizing the underlying spectroscopic

cosmological analyses, motivating a new simulation tool for the next era of SN
Ia cosmology: Build Your Own Spectral Energy Distribution (BYOSED). BYOSED is
used within the SNANA framework to simulate light curves by applying spectral
variations to model SEDs, enabling flexible testing of possible systematic
shifts in SN Ia distance measurements. We test the framework by comparing a
nominal Roman SN Ia survey simulation using a baseline SED model to simulations
using SEDs perturbed with BYOSED, and investigate the impact of neglecting
specific SED features in the analysis. These features include semi-empirical
models of two possible, predicted relationships: between SN ejecta velocity and
light curve observables, and a redshift-dependent relationship between SN
Hubble residuals and host galaxy mass. We analyze each BYOSED simulation using
the SALT2 &amp; BBC framework, and estimate changes in the measured value of the

eV. In $\Lambda$CDM, with an X-ray mass bias corresponding to the expected
hydrostatic mass bias, i.e., $(1-b)\simeq0.8$, our constraints from Planck SZ
data are consistent with the latest results from SPT, DES-Y1 and
KiDS+VIKING-450. In $\nu\Lambda$CDM, our joint analyses of Planck SZ with
Planck 2015 primary CMB yield a small improvement on the total neutrino mass
bound compared to the Planck 2015 primary CMB constraint, as well as
$(1-b)=0.64\pm0.04$~(68\%~CL). For forecasts, we find that competitive neutrino
mass measurements using cosmic variance limited SZ power spectrum require
masking the heaviest clusters and probing the small-scale SZ power spectrum up
to $\ell_\mathrm{max}\approx10^4$. Although this is challenging, we find that
SZ power spectrum can realistically be used to tightly constrain intra-cluster
medium properties: we forecast a 2\% determination of the X-ray mass bias by
combining CMB-S4 and our mock SZ power spectrum with $\ell_\mathrm{max}=10^3$.

          <p>Intrinsic alignments (IAs) of galaxies are an important contaminant for
cosmic shear studies, but the modelling is complicated by the dependence of the
signal on the source galaxy sample. In this paper, we use the halo model
formalism to capture this diversity and examine its implications for Stage-III
and Stage-IV cosmic shear surveys. We account for the different IA signatures
at large and small scales, as well for the different contributions from
central/satellite and red/blue galaxies, and we use realistic mocks to account
for the characteristics of the galaxy populations as a function of redshift. We
inform our model using the most recent observational findings: we include a
luminosity dependence at both large and small scales and a radial dependence of
the signal within the halo. We predict the impact of the total IA signal on the
lensing angular power spectra, including the current uncertainties from the IA
best-fits to illustrate the range of possible impact on the lensing signal: the
lack of constraints for fainter galaxies is the main source of uncertainty for
our predictions of the IA signal. We investigate how well effective models with
limited degrees of freedom can account for the complexity of the IA signal.
Although these lead to negligible biases for Stage-III surveys, we find that,
for Stage-IV surveys, it is essential to at least include an additional
parameter to capture the redshift dependence.

$A_\mu^a$ are coupled to cold dark matter by the term
$f(X)\tilde{\mathcal{L}}_{m}$ where $f(X)$ is a general function of $X\equiv
-\frac{1}{2}A^\mu_ a A^a_\mu$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{L}}_{m}$ is the cold dark
matter Lagrangian. From here, we derive the general covariant form of the novel
interaction term sourcing the field equations. This result is quite general in
the sense that encompasses Abelian and non-Abelian vector fields. In
particular, we investigate the effects of this type of coupling in a simple
dark energy model based on three copies of canonical Maxwell fields to realize
isotropic expansion. The cosmological background dynamics of the model is
examined by means of a dynamical system analysis to determine the stability of
the emergent cosmological solutions. As an interesting result, we find that the
coupling function leads to the existence of a novel scaling solution during the
dark matter dominance. Furthermore, the critical points show an early
contribution of the vector field in the form of dark radiation and a stable de
Sitter-type attractor at late times mimicking dark energy. The cosmological
evolution of the system as well as the aforementioned features are verified by
numerical computations. Observational constraints are also discussed to put the

          <p>Passive early-type galaxies dominate cluster cores at z $\lesssim$1.5. At
higher redshift, cluster core galaxies are observed to have still on-going
star-formation, fuelled by cold molecular gas. We measure the molecular gas
reservoir of the central region around the radio-loud AGN in the cluster CARLA
J1103+3449 at z=1.44 with NOEMA. The AGN synchrotron emission dominates the
continuum emission at 94.48 GHz, and we measure its flux at the AGN position
and at the position of two radio jets. Combining our measurements with
published results over the range 4.71 GHz-94.5 GHz, we obtain a flat spectral
index $\alpha = 0.14 \pm 0.03$ for the AGN core emission, and a steeper index
$\alpha = 1.43 \pm 0.04$ and $\alpha = 1.15 \pm 0.04$ at positions close to the
western and eastern lobe, respectively. The total spectral index is $\alpha =
0.92 \pm 0.02$ over the range 73.8 MHz-94.5 GHz. We detect two CO(2-1) emission
lines, both blue-shifted with respect to the AGN. Their emission corresponds to
two regions, ~17 kpc south-east and ~14 kpc south-west of the AGN, not
associated with galaxies. In these two regions, we find a total massive
molecular gas reservoir of $M_{gas}$ = 3.9 $\pm$ 0.4 $10^{10} M_{\odot}$, which
dominates (~ 60%) the central total molecular gas reservoir. These results can
be explained by massive cool gas flows in the center of the cluster. The AGN
early-type host is not yet quenched; its star formation rate is consistent with
being on the main sequence of star-forming galaxies in the field (SFR~30-140
$M_{\odot}$/yr), and the cluster core molecular gas reservoir is expected to
feed the AGN and the host star-formation before quiescence. The other cluster
confirmed members show star formation rates at ~2 $\sigma$ below the field main
sequence at similar redshifts and do not have molecular gas masses larger than
galaxies of similar stellar mass in the field.

of binary black holes in the LIGO mass range. While for a Poissonian initial
distribution, and assuming isolated binaries, the allowed fraction of
Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) to dark matter (DM) is a few percent, we show
that this bound can be relaxed if PBHs are clustered. More precisely we show
that for large clustering the merger rate can drop with increasing fraction of
PBHs, introducing a degeneracy in the parameters of the theory consistent with
a given present merger rate, and allowing all the DM to be in the form of
stellar mass PBHs. This degeneracy can however be broken by looking at the
evolution of the merger rate with redshift. For a simple clustering model that
we consider, we show that the LIGO projected sensitivity can disentangle,
through the observation of a stochastic background of gravitational waves,
different clustered distributions having the same present merger rate.

violation model, along with a machine learning reconstruction method based on
the Genetic Algorithms. We find that GW provide an alternative to the use of
BAO data to constrain violations of the DDR, reaching $3\%$ constraints on the

by a factor of $\approx1.4$ if one instead considers the combination of BAO and
SNIa. We also investigate the possibility that a neglected modification of
gravity might lead to a false detection of DDR violations, even when screening
mechanisms are active. We find that such a false detection can be extremely
significant, up to $\approx10\sigma$ for very extreme modified gravity
scenarios, while this reduces to $\approx4\sigma$ in a more realistic case.
False detections can also provide a smoking gun for the modified gravity
mechanism at play, as a result of the tension introduced between the SNIa+GW

          <p>Recent X-ray observations have revealed remarkable correlations between the
masses of central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the X-ray properties of
the hot atmospheres permeating their host galaxies, thereby indicating the
crucial role of the atmospheric gas in tracing SMBH growth in the high-mass
regime. We examine this topic theoretically using the IllustrisTNG cosmological
simulations and provide insights to the nature of this SMBH -- gaseous halo
connection. By carrying out a mock X-ray analysis for a mass-selected sample of
TNG100 simulated galaxies at $z=0$, we inspect the relationship between the
masses of SMBHs and the hot gas temperatures and luminosities at various
spatial and halo scales -- from galactic ($\sim R_{\rm e}$) to group/cluster
scales ($\sim R_{\rm 500c}$). We find strong SMBH-X-ray correlations mostly in
quenched galaxies and find that the correlations become stronger and tighter at
larger radii. Critically, the X-ray temperature ($k_{\rm B}T_{\rm X}$) at large
radii ($r\gtrsim5R_{\rm e}$) traces the SMBH mass with a remarkably small
scatter ($\sim0.2$ dex). The relations emerging from IllustrisTNG are broadly
consistent with those obtained from recent X-ray observations. Overall, our
analysis suggests that, within the framework of IllustrisTNG, the present-time
$M_{\rm BH}-k_{\rm B}T_{X}$ correlations at the high-mass end ($M_{\rm
BH}\gtrsim 10^8 M_\odot$) are fundamentally a reflection of the SMBH mass --
halo mass relation, which at such high masses is set by the hierarchical
assembly of structures. The exact form, locus, and scatter of those scaling
relations are, however, sensitive to feedback processes such as those driven by
star formation and SMBH activity.

standard perturbation theory and effective field theory to deal with non-linear

$\ell &lt; 10$. Even though this deviation is of order $2\%$ maximum for cosmic
lensing, we find the biggest effect for galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy
lensing. We show that not only is this true for upcoming galaxy surveys, but
also for current data such as DES Y1. Finally, we make our pipeline and
analysis publicly available as a Python package called unequalpy.

          <p>We report the first detection at 4.7 and 8.2 GHz with the RATAN-600 radio
telescope of the source PSO J047.4478+27.2992, which has been announced as a
blazar at z=6.1. The average flux density is $12\pm3$ and $8\pm4$ mJy at 4.7
and 8.2 GHz respectively, and an upper limit is estimated as 3 mJy at 11.2 GHz.
The light curve at 4.7 GHz, obtained on a time-scale of four months, exhibits
moderate variability of the source (fractional variability
$F_{var}=0.28\pm0.02$). The new RATAN-600 measurements extend previous
literature data to higher frequencies, indicating a single power-law radio
spectrum with $\alpha_{0.147-8.2}$=$-0.51\pm0.1$. The monochromatic radio
luminosity at 4.7 GHz $P_{\nu} \sim 2 \times 10^{27}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ is consistent
with values for high-redshift quasars at $z\geq 3$.

          <p>Interpreting observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum
requires interpolation between a small number of expensive simulations. We
present a Gaussian process emulator modelling the 1D flux power spectrum as a
function of the amplitude and slope of the small-scale linear matter power
spectrum, and the state of the intergalactic medium at the epoch of interest
($2 &lt; z &lt; 4$). This parameterisation enables the prediction of the flux power
spectrum in extended cosmological models that are not explicitly included in
the training set, eliminating the need to construct bespoke emulators for a
number of extensions to $\Lambda$CDM. We demonstrate this for massive neutrino
cosmologies, where the emulator is able to predict the flux power spectrum in a
$\Sigma m_\nu=0.3$ eV neutrino cosmology to sub-percent accuracy, without
including massive neutrinos in the training simulations. This work will
facilitate the combination of upcoming data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument with observations of the cosmic microwave background, to obtain
constraints on neutrino mass and other extensions to $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

          <p>In this work, we use the constrained Gaussian realization technique to study
the early growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations, exploring its relationship with features of the
initial density peaks on large scales, ~1 Mpc/h. Our constrained simulations of
volume (20 Mpc/h)^3 successfully reconstruct the large-scale structure as well
as the black hole growth for the hosts of the rare 10^9 Msun SMBHs found in the
BlueTides simulation at z~7. We run a set of simulations with constrained
initial conditions by imposing a 5 \sigma_0(R_G) peak on scale of R_G = 1 Mpc/h
varying different peak features, such as the shape and compactness as well as
the tidal field surrounding the peak. We find that initial density peaks with
high compactness and low tidal field induce the most rapid BH growth at early
epochs. This is because compact density peaks with a more spherical large scale
matter distribution lead to the formation of high density gas clumps in the
centers of halos, and thus boost early BH accretion. Moreover, such initially
compact density peaks in low tidal field regions also lead to a more compact BH
host galaxy morphology. This can explain the tight correlation between BH
growth and host galaxy compactness seen in observations.

        <strong>The DFSZ axion in the CMB. (arXiv:2012.06566v1 [hep-ph] CROSS LISTED)</strong>

          <p>We perform for the first time a dedicated analysis of cosmological
constraints on DFSZ QCD axion models. Such constructions are especially
interesting in light of the recent Xenon-1T excess and of hints from stellar
cooling. In DFSZ models, for $m_a\gtrsim 0.1$ eV, scatterings of pions and
muons can produce a sizable cosmic background of thermal axions, that behave
similarly to massive neutrinos. However, the pion coupling depends on the
alignment between the vevs of two Higgs doublets, and can be significantly
suppressed or enhanced with respect to the KSVZ scenario. Using the latest
Planck and BAO data, we find $m_a\leq 0.2~\text{eV}$ at $95\%$ C.L., when the
axion coupling to pions $c_{a\pi}$ is maximal. Constraints on $m_a$, instead,
can be significantly relaxed when $c_{a\pi}$ is small. In particular, we point
out that in the so-called DFSZ-II model, where the axion coupling to leptons
does not vanish simultaneously with $c_{a\pi}$, production via muons gives
$m_a\leq 0.6~\text{eV}$ at $95\%$ C.L., whereas in the DFSZ-I model bounds on
$m_a$ can be fully lifted. We then combine cosmological data with recent hints
of a DFSZ axion coupled to electrons from the Xenon-1T experiment, finding in
this case that the axion mass is constrained to be in the window $0.07
~\text{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 1.8\, (0.3)~\text{eV}$ for the DFSZ-I
(DFSZ-II) model. A similar analysis with stellar cooling hints gives $3
~\text{meV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 0.2 ~\text{eV}$ for DFSZ-II, while no
constraint arises in the DFSZ-I case. Forthcoming CMB Stage 4 experiments will
be able to further test such scenarios; for instance the Xenon-1T window should
be fully probed at $2\sigma$ for a DFSZ-I axion.
