          <p>Massive neutrinos suppress the growth of structure on small scales and leave
an imprint on large-scale structure that can be measured to constrain their
total mass, $M_\nu$. With standard analyses of two-point clustering statistics,
$M_\nu$ constraints are severely limited by parameter degeneracies. Hahn et
al.(2020) demonstrated that the bispectrum, the next higher-order statistic,
can break these degeneracies and dramatically improve constraints on $M_\nu$
and other cosmological parameters. In this paper, we present the constraining
power of the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum, $B_0^g$. We construct the Molino
suite of 75,000 mock galaxy catalogs from the Quijote $N$-body simulations
using the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model, which provides a galaxy
bias framework well-suited for simulation-based approaches. Using these mocks,
we present Fisher matrix forecasts for $\{\Omega_m,\Omega_b,h,n_s,\sigma_8,
M_\nu\}$ and quantify, for the first time, the total information content of
$B_0^g$ down to nonlinear scales. For $k_{\rm max}=0.5h/Mpc$, $B_0^g$ improves
constraints on $\Omega_m,\Omega_b,h,n_s,\sigma_8$, and $M_\nu$ by 2.8, 3.1,
3.8, 4.2, 4.2, and $4.6\times$ over the power spectrum, after marginalizing
over HOD parameters. Even with priors from $Planck$, $B_0^g$ improves all of
the cosmological constraints by $\gtrsim2\times$. In fact, for $P_\ell^g$ and
$B_0^g$ out to $k_{\rm max}=0.5h/Mpc$ with $Planck$ priors, we achieve a
$1\sigma$ $M_\nu$ constraint of 0.048 eV, which is tighter than the current
best cosmological constraint. While effects such as survey geometry and
assembly bias will have an impact, these constraints are derived for
$(1h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$, a substantially smaller volume than upcoming surveys.
Therefore, we conclude that the galaxy bispectrum will significantly improve
cosmological constraints for upcoming galaxy surveys -- especially for $M_\nu$.

          <p>The angular momentum of dark matter haloes controls their spin magnitude and
orientation, which in turn influences the galaxies therein. However, the
process by which dark matter haloes acquire angular momentum is not fully
understood. We present an extension to the genetic modification technique which
allows us to control the angular momentum of any region in the initial
conditions. Using a suite of simulations, we investigate whether changes to the
angular momentum of a specified region in the evolved Universe can be
accurately predicted from changes in the initial conditions. We find that the
angular momentum in regions with modified initial conditions can be predicted
significantly more accurately than expected from applying tidal torque theory.
This result is masked when analysing the angular momentum of haloes, because
particles in the outskirts of haloes dominate the angular momentum budget. We
conclude that the angular momentum of Lagrangian patches is highly predictable
from the initial conditions, with apparent stochastic or chaotic behaviour
being driven by halo membership criteria.

          <p>Fluctuation dynamos are thought to play an essential role in magnetized
galaxy evolution, saturating within $\sim0.01~$Gyr and thus potentially acting
as seeds for large-scale dynamos. However, unambiguous observational
confirmation of the fluctuation dynamo action in a galactic environment is
still missing. This is because, in spiral galaxies, it is difficult to
differentiate between small-scale magnetic fields generated by a fluctuation
dynamo and those due to the tangling of the large-scale field. We propose that
observations of magnetic fields in elliptical galaxies would directly probe the
fluctuation dynamo action. This is motivated by the fact that in ellipticals,
due to their lack of significant rotation, the conventional large-scale dynamo
is absent and the fluctuation dynamo is responsible for controlling the
magnetic field strength and structure. By considering turbulence injected by
Type Ia supernova explosions and possible magnetic field amplification by
cooling flows, we estimate expected magnetic field strengths of $0.2~-~1
\,\mu{\rm G}$ in quiescent elliptical galaxies. We use a semi-analytic model of
galaxy formation to estimate the distribution and redshift evolution of field
strengths, tentatively finding a decrease in magnetic field strength with
decreasing redshift. We analyse a sample of radio sources that exhibit the
Laing-Garrington (LG) effect (radio polarization asymmetry in jets) and infer
magnetic field strengths between $0.14~-~1.33 \,\mu{\rm G}$ for a uniform
thermal electron density and between $1.36~-~6.21\,\mu{\rm G}$ for the thermal
electron density following the King profile. We examine observational
techniques for measuring the magnetic field saturation state in elliptical
galaxies, focusing on Faraday RM grids, the LG effect, synchrotron emission,
and gravitational lensing, finding appealing prospects for future empirical
analysis.

          <p>Most galaxies in the nearby Universe are gravitationally bound to a cluster
or group of galaxies. Their optical contents, such as optical richness, are
crucial for understanding the co-evolution of galaxies and large-scale
structures in modern astronomy and cosmology. The determination of optical
richness can be challenging. We propose a self-supervised approach for
estimating optical richness from multi-band optical images. The method uses the
data properties of the multi-band optical images for pre-training, which
enables learning feature representations from a large but unlabeled dataset. We
apply the proposed method to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The result shows our
estimate of optical richness lowers the mean absolute error and intrinsic

training data by up to 60%. We believe the proposed method will benefit
astronomy and cosmology, where a large number of unlabeled multi-band images
are available, but acquiring image labels is costly.

bands, compared with NASA's $Spitzer$ and WISE space telescopes, which had only
four filters with a wide gap in the MIR. The $AKARI$ NEPW field lacked deep and
homogeneous optical data, limiting the use of nearly half of the IR sources for
extra-galactic studies owing to the absence of photometric redshifts
(photo-zs). To remedy this, we have recently obtained deep optical imaging over
the NEPW field with 5 bands ($g$, $r$, $i$, $z$, and $Y$) of the Hyper
Suprime-Camera (HSC) on the Subaru 8m telescope. We optically identify AKARI-IR
sources along with supplementary $Spitzer$ and WISE data as well as
pre-existing optical data. In this work, we derive new photo-zs using a

from 26 selected filters including HSC, $AKARI$, CFHT, Maidanak, KPNO,

          <p>The correlation between the peak spectra energy and the equivalent isotropic
energy of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the so-called Amati relation, is often
used to constrain the high-redshift Hubble diagram of the universe. Assuming
Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, Wang et al. found a $\gtrsim
3\sigma$ tension in the data-calibrated Amati coefficients between low- and
high-redshift GRB samples. To test whether beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology could
resolve the tension, we use PAge approximation, an almost model-independent
cosmology framework to revisit the redshift evolution of Amati relation. We
find that the low- and high-redshift tension of Amati relation remains at $\sim
3\sigma$ level in the PAge framework. Thus, for the broad class of models
covered by PAge approximation, caution needs to be taken for the use of GRBs as
high-redshift distance indicators.

the scattering process depends highly on the structure of target atoms. We
reevaluate the scattering cross section with a realistic atomic form factor and
find that it can differ from the previous results by more than an order of
magnitude. It is also found that inelastic scattering processes, in which the
final state contains an excited or ionized atom, can be comparable or even be
dominant when the size of momentum transfer is $\lesssim 1$ keV. In addition,
we consider the scattering of supernova axions, whose energy is O(10) MeV, and
show that the cross section rarely depends on the atomic structure in this
case. We also point out that O(1) inverse Primakoff events are expected for
axions from a nearby supernova in the future neutrino experiments, which may
warrant a more detailed study on the search strategy of this process.

          <p>Brief periods of non-slow-roll evolution during inflation can produce
interesting observable consequences, as primordial black holes, or an
inflationary gravitational wave spectrum enhanced at small scales. We develop a
model independent, analytic approach for studying the predictions of
single-field scenarios which include short phases of slow-roll violation. Our
method is based on Taylor expanding the equations for cosmological fluctuations
in a small quantity, which parameterizes the duration of the non-slow-roll
eras. The super-horizon spectrum of perturbations is described by few effective
parameters, and is characterized by a pronounced dip followed by a rapid growth
in its amplitude, as typically found in numerical and analytical studies. The
dip position $k_{\rm dip}/k_*$ and the maximal enhancement $\Pi_{\rm max}$ of
the spectrum towards small scales are found to be related by the law $k_{\rm
dip}/k_*\propto \Pi_{\rm max}^{-1/4}$, and we determine the proportionality
constant. For a single epoch of slow-roll violation we confirm previous
studies, finding that the steepest slope of the spectrum well after the dip has
spectral index $n-1\,=\,4$. On the other hand, with multiple phases of
slow-roll violation, the slope of the spectrum is generally enhanced. For
example, when two epochs of slow-roll violation take place, separated by a
phase of quasi-de Sitter expansion, we find that the spectral index can reach
the value $n-1\,=\,8$. This phenomenon indicates that the slope of the spectrum
keeps memory of the history of non-slow-roll phases occurred during inflation.

          <p>We identify a characteristic pattern in the scalar-induced stochastic
gravitational wave background from particle production during inflation. If
particle production is sufficiently efficient, the scalar power spectrum
exhibits $\mathcal{O}(1)$ oscillations periodic in $k$, characteristic of a
sharp feature, with an exponentially enhanced envelope. We systematically study
the properties of the induced spectrum of gravitational waves sourced after
inflation and find that this inherits the periodic structure in $k$, resulting
in a peak in the gravitational wave energy density spectrum with
$\mathcal{O}(10 \%)$ modulations. The frequency of the oscillation in the
scalar power spectrum is determined by the scale of the feature during
inflation and in turn sets the frequency of modulations in the gravitational
wave signal. We present an explicit realisation of this phenomenon in the
framework of multifield inflation, in the form of a strong sharp turn in the
inflationary trajectory. The resulting stochastic background is potentially
detectable in future gravitational wave observatories, and considerations of
backreaction and perturbativity can be used to constrain the parameter space
from the theoretical side. Our work motivates more extensive research linking
primordial features to observable properties of the stochastic background of
gravitational waves, and dedicated development in data analysis for their
detection.

          <p>We constrain cosmological parameters from a joint cosmic shear analysis of
peak-counts and the two-point shear correlation function, as measured from the
Dark Energy Survey (DES-Y1). We find the structure growth parameter $S_8\equiv
\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.766^{+0.033}_{-0.038}$, which at 4.8%
precision, provides one of the tightest constraints on $S_8$ from the DES-Y1
weak lensing data. In our simulation-based method we determine the expected
DES-Y1 peak-count signal for a range of cosmologies sampled in four $w$CDM
parameters ($\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\sigma_8$, $h$, $w_0$). We also determine the
joint peak-correlation function covariance matrix with over 1000 realisations
at our fiducial cosmology. With mock DES-Y1 data we calibrate the impact of
photometric redshift and shear calibration uncertainty on the peak-count,
marginalising over these uncertainties in our cosmological analysis. Using
dedicated training samples we show that our measurements are unaffected by mass
resolution limits in the simulation, and that our constraints are robust
against uncertainty in the effect of baryon feedback. Accurate modelling for
the impact of intrinsic alignments on the tomographic peak-count remains a
challenge, currently limiting our exploitation of cross-correlated peak counts
between high and low redshift bins. We demonstrate that once calibrated, a
fully tomographic joint peak-count and correlation function analysis has the
potential to reach a 3% precision on $S_8$ for DES-Y1. Our methodology can be
adopted to model any statistic that is sensitive to the non-Gaussian
information encoded in the shear field. In order to accelerate the development
of these beyond-two-point cosmic shear studies, our simulations are made
available to the community, on request.

          <p>A complete census of baryons in the late universe is a long-standing
challenge due to the intermediate temperate and rarefied character of the
majority of cosmic gas. To gain insight into this problem, we extract
measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect from the
cross-correlation of angular redshift fluctuations maps, which contain precise
information about the cosmic density and velocity fields, and CMB maps
high-pass filtered using aperture photometry; we refer to this technique as
ARF-kSZ tomography. Remarkably, we detect significant cross-correlation for a
wide range of redshifts and filter apertures using 6dF galaxies, BOSS galaxies,
and SDSS quasars as tracers, yielding a 11 sigma detection of the kSZ effect.
We then leverage these measurements to set constraints on the location,
density, and abundance of gas inducing the kSZ effect, finding that this gas
resides outside dark matter haloes, presents densities ranging from 10 to 250
times the cosmic average, and comprises half of cosmic baryons. Taken together,
these findings indicate that ARF-kSZ tomography provides a nearly complete
census of intergalactic gas from z=0 to 5.

temperature and polarization anisotropy from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope,

17,000 deg$^2$, the deepest 600 deg$^2$ with noise levels below 10
$\mu$K-arcmin. We use the power spectrum derived from almost 6,000 deg$^2$ of

angular scale of features in both the divergence-like polarization and the
temperature anisotropy, tracing both the velocity and density at
last-scattering. From these one can derive the distance to the last-scattering
surface and thus infer the local expansion rate, $H_0$. By combining ACT data
with large-scale information from WMAP we measure $H_0 = 67.6 \pm 1.1$
km/s/Mpc, at 68% confidence, in excellent agreement with the
independently-measured Planck satellite estimate (from ACT alone we find $H_0 =
67.9 \pm 1.5$ km/s/Mpc). The $\Lambda$CDM model provides a good fit to the ACT
data, and we find no evidence for deviations: both the spatial curvature, and
the departure from the standard lensing signal in the spectrum, are zero to
within 1$\sigma$; the number of relativistic species, the primordial Helium
fraction, and the running of the spectral index are consistent with
$\Lambda$CDM predictions to within $1.5 - 2.2\sigma$. We compare ACT, WMAP, and
Planck at the parameter level and find good consistency; we investigate how the

readjust when adding CMB large-scale information that ACT does not measure. The

The scatter in the measurements is larger for the blind mocks, due to the

          <p>Accurate mock catalogues are essential for assessing systematics in the
cosmological analysis of large galaxy surveys. Anisotropic two-point clustering
measurements from the same simulation show some scatter for different lines of
sight (LOS), but are on average equal, due to cosmic variance. This results in
scatter in the measured cosmological parameters. We use the OuterRim N-body
simulation halo catalogue to investigate this, considering the 3 simulation
axes as LOS. The quadrupole of the 2-point statistics is particularly sensitive
to changes in the LOS, with sub-percent level differences in the velocity
distributions resulting in ~1.5$\sigma$ shifts on large scales. Averaging over
multiple LOS can reduce the impact of cosmic variance. We derive an expression
for the Gaussian cross-covariance between the power spectrum multipole
measurements, for any two LOS, including shot noise, and the corresponding
reduction in variance in the average measurement. Quadrupole measurements are
anti-correlated, and for three orthogonal LOS, the variance on the average
measurement is reduced by more than 1/3. We perform a Fisher analysis to
predict the corresponding gain in precision on the cosmological parameter
measurements, which we compare against a set of 300 extended Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) emission line galaxy (ELG) EZmocks. The gain in
$f\sigma_8$, which measures the growth of structure, is also better than 1/3.
Averaging over multiple LOS in future mock challenges will allow the RSD models
to be constrained with the same systematic error, with less than 3 times the

          <p>Primordial Black Holes (PBH) with masses of order $10-30 M_\odot$ have been
proposed as a possible explanation of the gravitational waves emission events
recently discovered by the LIGO observatory. If true, then PBHs would
constitute a sizeable fraction of the dark matter component in the Universe.
Using a series of cosmological N-body simulations which include both dark
matter and a variable fraction of PBHs ranging from $f_{PBH} = 10^{-4}$ to
$f_{PBH} = 1$, we analyse the processes of formation and disruption of
gravitationally bound PBH pairs, as well as the merging of both bound and
unbound pairs, and estimate the probabilities of such events. We show that they
are in good agreement with the constrains to the PBH abundance obtained by the
LIGO and other research groups. We find that pair stability, while being a main
factor responsible for the merger rate, is significantly affected by the
effects of dark matter halo formation and clustering. As a side result, we also
evaluate the effects of numerical errors in the stability of bound pairs, which

update of abundance predictions for light elements produced during the big-bang

We point out a new $\simeq1.8\sigma$-tension on the baryonic density, or
equivalently on the D/H abundance, between the value inferred on one hand from
the analysis of the primordial abundances of light elements and, on the other
hand, from the combination of CMB and baryonic oscillation data. This draws the
attention on this sector of the theory and gives us the opportunity to

          <p>The present work deals with the evolution of the density contrasts for a
cosmological model where along with the standard cold dark matter (CDM), the
present Universe also contains holographic dark energy (HDE). The
characteristic infra-red (IR) cut-off is taken as the future event horizon. The
HDE is allowed to interact with the CDM. The equations for the density
contrasts are integrated numerically. It is found that irrespective of the
presence of an interaction, the matter perturbation has growing modes. The HDE
is also found to have growth of perturbation, so very much like the CDM, thus
can also cluster. The interesting point to note is that the density contrast
corresponding to HDE has a peak at recent past and is decaying at the present
epoch. Another feature is that IR cut-off as the event horizon does not
naturally produce accelerated expansion of the Universe in the presence of an
interaction.

          <p>We present a new theoretical picture of magnetically dominated, decaying
turbulence in the absence of a mean magnetic field. We demonstrate that such
turbulence is governed by the reconnection of magnetic structures, and not by
ideal dynamics, as has previously been assumed. We obtain predictions for the
magnetic-energy decay laws by proposing that turbulence decays on reconnection
timescales, while respecting the conservation of certain integral invariants
representing topological constraints satisfied by the reconnecting magnetic
field. As is well known, the magnetic helicity is such an invariant for
initially helical field configurations, but does not constrain non-helical
decay, where the volume-averaged magnetic-helicity density vanishes. For such a
decay, we propose a new integral invariant, analogous to the Loitsyansky and
Saffman invariants of hydrodynamic turbulence, that expresses the conservation
of the random (scaling as $\mathrm{volume}^{1/2}$) magnetic helicity contained
in any sufficiently large volume. Our treatment leads to novel predictions for
the magnetic-energy decay laws: in particular, while we expect the canonical
$t^{-2/3}$ power law for helical turbulence when reconnection is fast (i.e.,
plasmoid-dominated or stochastic), we find a shallower $t^{-4/7}$ decay in the
slow `Sweet-Parker' reconnection regime, in better agreement with existing
numerical simulations. For non-helical fields, for which there currently exists
no definitive theory, we predict power laws of $t^{-10/9}$ and $t^{-20/17}$ in
the fast- and slow-reconnection regimes, respectively. We formulate a general
principle of decay of turbulent systems subject to conservation of Saffman-like
invariants, and propose how it may be applied to MHD turbulence with a strong
mean magnetic field and to isotropic MHD turbulence with initial equipartition
between the magnetic and kinetic energies.

        <strong>Quantum backreaction of $O(N)$-symmetric scalar fields and de Sitter spacetimes at the renormalization point: renormalization schemes and the screening of the cosmological constant. (arXiv:2012.01816v1 [hep-th] CROSS LISTED)</strong>

          <p>We consider a theory of $N$ self-interacting quantum scalar fields with
quartic $O(N)$-symmetric potential, with a coupling constant $\lambda$, in a
generic curved spacetime. We analyze the renormalization process of the
Semiclassical Einstein Equations at leading order in the $1/N$ expansion for
different renormailzation schemes, namely: the traditional one that sets the
geometry of the spacetime to be Minkowski at the renormalization point, and new
schemes (originally proposed in [1,2]) which set the geometry to be that of a
fixed de Sitter spacetime. In particular, we study the quantum backreaction for
fields in de Sitter spacetimes with masses much smaller than the expansion rate
$H$. We find that the scheme that uses the classical de Sitter background
solution at the renormalization point, stands out as the most appropriate to
study the quantum effects on de Sitter spacetimes. Adopting such scheme we
obtain the backreaction is suppressed by $H^2/M_{pl}^2$ with no logarithmic
enhancement factor of $\ln{\lambda}$, giving only a small screening of the
classical cosmological constant due to the backreaction of such quantum fields.
We point out the use of the new schemes can also be more appropriate than the
traditional one to study quantum effects in other spacetimes relevant for
cosmology.
