          <p>We study the impact of cosmological scale modifications to General Relativity
on the dynamics of halos within voids by comparing N-body simulations
incorporating Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity, with $|f_{R0}|=10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$,
to those of $\Lambda$CDM. By examining the radial velocity statistics within
voids classified based on their size and density-profile, as "rising"
($R$-type) or "shell" ($S$-type), we find that halo motions in small $R$-type
voids, with effective radius $&lt;15 Mpc/h$, reveal distinctive differences
between $f(R)$ and $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies.
</p>
<p>To understand this observed effect, we study the linear and nonlinear fifth
forces, and develop an iterative algorithm to accurately solve the non-linear
fifth force equation. We use this to characterize the Chameleon screening
mechanism in voids and contrast the behavior with that observed in
gravitationally collapsed objects.
</p>
<p>The force analysis underscores how smaller $R$-type voids exhibit the highest
ratios of fifth force to Newtonian force, which source distinguishable
differences in the velocity profiles and thereby provide rich environments in
which to constrain gravity.

          <p>The Ly$\alpha$ forest decomposed into Voigt profile components (or "clouds")
allow us to study clustering properties of the intergalactic medium and its
dependence on various physical quantities. Here, we report the first detections
of longitudinal three-point ($\zeta$) and reduced three-point (Q) correlations
of low-$z$ (i.e $z&lt;0.48$) Ly$\alpha$ clouds over a scale of $r_\parallel\leq 4$
pMpc. We measure $\zeta = 6.9\pm 1.3$ and Q = 1.7$\pm$0.4 at a transverse
separation of 1-2 pMpc. We show the amplitude of $\zeta$ increases with
increasing HI column density ($N_{\rm HI}$) while Q does not show any $N_{\rm
HI}$ dependence. We find the radial profile of $\zeta$ to be different for
high-$b$ (i.e $b&gt;$40 km/s) and low-$b$ absorbers. About 84% of the triplets
contributing to $\zeta$ have nearby galaxies within a velocity separation of
500 km/s and a median impact parameter of 405 pkpc. The measured impact
parameters are consistent with appreciable number of triplets not originating
from individual galaxies but tracing the underlying galaxy distribution.
Frequency of occurrence of high-$b$ absorbers in triplets ($\sim$88%) is a
factor $\sim3$ higher than that found among the full sample ($\sim$32%). Using
four different cosmological simulations, we quantify the effect of peculiar
velocities, feedback effects and show that most of the observed trends can be
broadly reproduced. However, $\zeta$ at small scales ($r_\parallel&lt;1$ pMpc) and
$b$-dependence of $\zeta$ in simulations are found inconsistent with the
observations. This could either be related to the fact that none of these
simulations reproduce the observed $b$-distribution and $N_{\rm HI}$
distribution for $N_{\rm HI}&gt;10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ self-consistently or to the
widespread of signal-to-noise ratio in the observed data.

          <p>We demonstrate that highly accurate joint redshift - stellar mass PDFs can be
obtained using the Random Forest (RF) machine learning (ML) algorithm, even
with few photometric bands available. As an example, we use the Dark Energy
Survey (DES), combined with the COSMOS2015 catalogue for redshifts and stellar
masses. We build two ML models: one containing deep photometry in the $griz$
bands, and the second reflecting the photometric scatter present in the main
DES survey, with carefully constructed representative training data in each
case. We validate our joint PDFs for $10,699$ test galaxies by utilising the
copula probability integral transform (copPIT) and the Kendall distribution
function, and their univariate counterparts to validate the marginals.
Benchmarked against a basic set-up of the template-fitting code BAGPIPES, our
ML-based method outperforms template fitting on all of our pre-defined
performance metrics. In addition to accuracy, the RF is extremely fast, able to
compute joint PDFs for a million galaxies in just over $2$ hours with consumer
computer hardware. Such speed enables PDFs to be derived in real-time within
analysis codes, solving potential storage issues. As part of this work we have
developed GALPRO, a highly intuitive and efficient Python package to rapidly
generate multivariate PDFs on-the-fly. GALPRO is documented and available for

          <p>Much of the cosmological utility thus far extracted from Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia) relies on the assumption that SN~Ia peak luminosities do not evolve
significantly with the age (local or global) of their stellar environments. Two
recent studies have provided conflicting results in evaluating the validity of
this assumption, with one finding no correlation between Hubble residuals (HR)
and stellar environment age, while the other claims a significant correlation.
In this Letter we perform an independent reanalysis that rectifies issues with
the statistical methods employed by both of the aforementioned studies. Our
analysis follows a principled approach that properly accounts for regression
dilution and critically (and unlike both prior studies) utilises the
Bayesian-model-produced SN environment age estimates (posterior samples)
instead of point estimates. Moreover, the posterior is used as an informative
prior in the regression. We find the Pearson correlation between the HR and
local (global) age to be in excess of $4\sigma$ ($3\sigma$). Assuming there
exists a linear relationship between HR and local (global) age, we find a
corresponding slope of $-0.035 \pm 0.007\,\mathrm{mag\,Gyr}^{-1}$ ($-0.036 \pm
0.007\,\mathrm{mag\,Gyr}^{-1}$). We encourage further usage of our approach to
examine possible cosmological implications of the HR and age correlation.

          <p>A string of recent studies have debated the possible presence of an
evolutionary trend between the peak luminosity attained by Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia) and the properties of the galaxies that host them. We shed new light
on the discussion by presenting an analysis of ~200 low-redshift SNe Ia in
which we measure the separation of Hubble residuals (HR; as probes of
luminosity) between two host-galaxy morphological types (as a probe of both age
and mass). We show that this separation can test the predictions made by
recently proposed models, using an independently and empirically determined
distribution of each morphological type in host-property space. Our results are
consistent with the previously known HR-mass step (or slope), but inconsistent
with newly proposed HR-age slopes, which we find to significantly overstate
what amounts only to a slight trend. In addition, we show that these two trends
-- HR-mass and HR-age correlation -- need to be consistent with each other,
given the significant correlation that we identify between age and mass in a
sample of galaxies. While our result clearly rejects the recently proposed
large HR-age slope, the correlations between mass, age, morphology, and HR
values are evident, keeping the HR-age slope relevant as an interesting topic
for discussion. Our results encourage further studies to determine the physical
origin of this relation between host environments and luminosity of SNe~Ia.

          <p>We investigate whether a Gaussian likelihood is sufficient to obtain accurate
parameter constraints from a Euclid-like combined tomographic power spectrum
analysis of weak lensing, galaxy clustering and their cross-correlation.
Testing its performance on the full sky against the Wishart distribution, which
is the exact likelihood under the assumption of Gaussian fields, we find that
the Gaussian likelihood returns accurate parameter constraints. This accuracy
is robust to the choices made in the likelihood analysis, including the choice
of fiducial cosmology, the range of scales included, and the random noise
level. We extend our results to the cut sky by evaluating the additional
non-Gaussianity of the joint cut-sky likelihood in both its marginal
distributions and dependence structure. We find that the cut-sky likelihood is
more non-Gaussian than the full-sky likelihood, but at a level insufficient to
introduce significant inaccuracy into parameter constraints obtained using the
Gaussian likelihood. Our results should not be affected by the assumption of
Gaussian fields, as this approximation only becomes inaccurate on small scales,
which in turn corresponds to the limit in which any non-Gaussianity of the
likelihood becomes negligible. We nevertheless compare against N-body weak
lensing simulations and find no evidence of significant additional
non-Gaussianity in the likelihood. Our results indicate that a Gaussian
likelihood will be sufficient for robust parameter constraints with power
spectra from Stage IV weak lensing surveys.

          <p>Advances in upcoming weak lensing surveys pose new challenges for an accurate
modeling of the lensing observables. With their large sky coverage, common
approximations based on a flat-sky geometry cannot be used anymore to evaluate
all measurable angular scales. Moreover, additional relativistic effects
manifest themselves on large scales and thus need to be accounted for. In
particular, the lensing magnification cannot be correctly described by the
standard lensing convergence only. We present the analytical solutions for the
fully-relativistic weak lensing angular power spectra, including the
contribution from primordial gravitational waves. We compare the results
obtained by using the Limber approximation with the precise all-sky
calculations using spherical harmonics. Our numerical evaluations show that
general relativistic corrections are one order-of-magnitude below cosmic
variance at small scales ($l\geq 10$). At large scales ($l&lt;10$), however,
neglecting them leads to more significant errors, especially when combined with
the Limber approximation. Hence, a precise, fully-relativistic modeling is

how these epochs can be studied with a specific form of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich

low-frequency radio interferometers such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization

realistic scenarios, we look into cosmic variance noise, incorporate and take
into account the effects of foregrounds, thermal noise, and angular resolution
for our simulated observations. We further extend this exploration by averaging
over a sample of galaxy clusters to mitigate the effects of cosmic variance and
instrumental noise. The impact of point source contamination is also studied.
Lastly, we apply this technique to the results of the EDGES collaboration,
which in 2018 reported an absorption feature of the global 21cm background
signal centred at 78 MHz. The challenges to be addressed in order to achieve
the objectives of this work include errors that arise due to cosmic variation,
instrumental noise and point source contamination. Our approach demonstrates
the potential of the SZE-21cm as an indirect probe for the DA and EoR, and we
conclude that the spectral features of the SZE-21cm from our simulated
observations yield results that are close to prior theoretical predictions and
that the SZE-21cm can be used to test the validity of the EDGES detection.

terms of the linear-theory rms mass fluctuation in spheres of radius

tension regarding the consistency between low-redshift probes and cosmic
microwave background data, and the way in which growth-rate estimates inferred
from redshift-space distortions are commonly expressed. We propose to abandon
the use of $h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ units in cosmology and to characterize the
amplitude of the matter power spectrum in terms of $\sigma_{12}$, defined as
the mass fluctuation in spheres of radius $12\,{\rm Mpc}$, whose value is
similar to the standard $\sigma_8$ for $h\sim 0.67$.

          <p>We conduct a thorough Bayesian analysis of the possibility that the black
hole merger events seen in gravitational waves are primordial black hole (PBH)
mergers. Using the latest merger rate models for PBH binaries drawn from a
lognormal mass function we compute posterior parameter constraints and Bayesian
evidences using data from the first two observing runs of LIGO-Virgo. We
account for theoretical uncertainty due to possible disruption of the binary by
surrounding PBHs, which can suppress the merger rate significantly. We also
consider simple astrophysically motivated models and find that these are
favoured decisively over the PBH scenario, quantified by the Bayesian evidence
ratio. Paying careful attention to the influence of the parameter priors and
the quality of the model fits, we show that the evidence ratios can be
understood by comparing the predicted chirp mass distribution to that of the
data. We identify the posterior predictive distribution of chirp mass as a
vital tool for discriminating between models. A model in which all mergers are
PBH binaries is strongly disfavoured compared with astrophysical models, in
part due to the over-prediction of heavy systems having $\mathcal{M}_{{\rm
chirp}} \gtrsim 40 \, M_\odot$ and positive skewness over the range of observed
masses which does not match the observations. We find that the fit is not
significantly improved by adding a maximum mass cut-off, a bimodal mass
function, or imposing that PBH binaries form at late times. We argue that a
successful PBH model must either modify the lognormal shape of the initial mass
function significantly or abandon the hypothesis that all observed merging
binaries are primordial. We develop and apply techniques for analysing PBH
models with gravitational wave data which will be necessary for robust
statistical inference as the gravitational wave source sample size increases.

          <p>We pioneer the black hole mass gap as a powerful new tool for constraining
modified gravity theories. These theories predict fifth forces that alter the
structure and evolution of population-III stars, exacerbating the
pair-instability. This results in the formation of lighter astrophysical black
holes and lowers both the upper and lower edges of the mass gap. These effects
are explored using detailed numerical simulations to derive quantitative
predictions that can be used as theoretical inputs for Bayesian data analysis.
We discuss detection strategies in light of current and upcoming data as well
as complications that may arise due to environmental screening. To demonstrate
the constraining power of the mass gap, we present a novel test of the strong
equivalence principle where we apply our results to an analysis of the first
ten LIGO/Virgo binary black hole merger events to obtain a $7\%$ bound on the
relative difference between the gravitational constant experienced by baryonic
matter, and that experienced by black holes, $\Delta G/G$. The recent GW190521
event resulting from two black holes with masses in the canonical mass gap can
be explained by modified gravity if the event originated from an unscreened
galaxy where the strength of gravity is enhanced by $\sim30\%$ or reduced by
$\sim 50\%$ relative to its strength in the solar system.

Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly~$\alpha$) photons on the global 21-cm signal at cosmic dawn
using an analytical expression of the spectrum around the Ly~$\alpha$ resonance
based on the so-called `wing approximation'. We derive a new expression for the

expression for the cooling due to injected Ly~$\alpha$ photons. We perform a
short parameter study by varying the Ly~$\alpha$ background intensity by four
orders of magnitude and establish that a strong Ly~$\alpha$ background is
necessary, although not sufficient, in order to reproduce the recently detected
stronger-than-expected 21-cm signal by the EDGES Collaboration. We show that
the magnitude of this Ly~$\alpha$ heating is smaller than previously estimated
in the literature by two orders of magnitude or more. As a result, even a
strong Ly~$\alpha$ background is consistent with the EDGES measurement. We also
provide a detailed discussion on different expressions of the Ly~$\alpha$

          <p>Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are excellent systems to probe the nature of
fermionic dark matter due to their high observed dark matter phase-space
density. In this work, we review, revise and improve upon previous phase-space
considerations to obtain lower bounds on the mass of fermionic dark matter
particles. The refinement in the results compared to previous works is realised
particularly due to a significantly improved Jeans analysis of the galaxies. We
discuss two methods to obtain phase-space bounds on the dark matter mass, one
model-independent bound based on Pauli's principle, and the other derived from
an application of Liouville's theorem. As benchmark examples for the latter
case, we derive constraints for thermally decoupled particles and
(non-)resonantly produced sterile neutrinos. Using the Pauli principle, we
report a model-independent lower bound of $m \geq 0.18\,\mathrm{keV}$ at 68% CL
and $m \geq 0.13\,\mathrm{keV}$ at 95% CL. For relativistically decoupled
thermal relics, this bound is strengthened to $m \geq 0.59\,\mathrm{keV}$ at
68% CL and $m \geq 0.41\,\mathrm{keV}$ at 95% CL, whilst for non-resonantly
produced sterile neutrinos the constraint is $m \geq 2.80\,\mathrm{keV}$ at 68%
CL and $m \geq 1.74\,\mathrm{keV}$ at 95% CL. Finally, the phase-space bounds
on resonantly produced sterile neutrinos are compared with complementary limits
from X-ray, Lyman-$\alpha$ and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis observations.

combination of inference from a cosmological N-body simulation with

          <p>One of the most interesting candidates for dark matter are massive real
scalar particles. A well-motivated example is from a pure Yang-Mills hidden
sector, which locks up into glueballs in the early universe. The lightest
glueball states are scalar particles and can act as a form of bosonic dark
matter. If self-interactions are repulsive this can potentially lead to very
massive boson stars, where the inward gravitational force is balanced by the
repulsive self-interaction. This can also arise from elementary real scalars
with a regular potential. In the literature it has been claimed that this
allows for astrophysically significant boson stars with high compactness, which
could undergo binary mergers and generate detectable gravitational waves. Here
we show that previous analyses did not take into proper account $3 \to 2$ and
$4 \to 2$ quantum mechanical annihilation processes in the core of the star,
while other work misinterpreted the classical $3 \to 1$ process. In this work,
we compute the annihilation rates, finding that massive stars will rapidly
decay from the $3 \to 2$ or $4 \to 2$ processes (while the $3 \to 1$ process is
typically small). Using the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations, we also estimate
the binding energy of these stars, showing that even the densest stars do not
have quite enough binding energy to prevent annihilations. For such boson stars
to live for the current age of the universe and to be consistent with bounds on
dark matter scattering in galaxies, we find the following upper bound on their
mass for $O(1)$ self-interaction couplings: $M_*&lt;10^{-18}M_{sun}$ when $3 \to
2$ processes are allowed and $M_*&lt;10^{-11}M_{sun}$ when only $4 \to 2$
processes are allowed. We also estimate destabilization from parametric
resonance which can considerably constrain the phase space further.
Furthermore, such stars are required to have very small compactness to be long
lived.

          <p>In first-order cosmological phase transitions, the asymptotic velocity of
expanding bubbles is of crucial relevance for predicting observables like the
spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves, or for establishing the viability
of mechanisms explaining fundamental properties of the universe such as the
observed baryon asymmetry. In these dynamic phase transitions, it is generally
accepted that subluminal bubble expansion requires out-of-equilibrium
interactions with the plasma which are captured by friction terms in the
equations of motion for the scalar field. We show that subluminal propagation
can still happen in the case of local equilibrium, in which the total entropy
remains conserved but bubbles slow down due to hydrodynamic effects across the
bubble wall associated with the field-dependence of the entropy density. These
effects can by accounted for by simply imposing local conservation of
stress-energy and including field dependent thermal contributions to the
effective potential. We illustrate this with explicit calculations of dynamical
and static bubbles for a first-order electroweak transition in a Standard Model
extension with additional scalar fields. The results qualitatively match with
recent analyses of friction forces in local equilibrium, which discard runaway
behaviours, although we find corrections from the temperature and velocity
gradients across the bubble. Even if local equilibrium is violated for some
particle species, the effects described here will apply for the background
plasma of the species that remain equilibrated, thereby leading to smaller
velocities.

          <p>We consider the generalisation of quantum tunneling transitions in the WKB
approximation to the time-independent functional Schr\"odinger and
Wheeler-DeWitt equations. Following a Lorentzian approach, we compute the
transition rates among different scalar field vacua and compare with those
performed by Coleman and collaborators using the Euclidean approach. For
gravity, we develop a general formalism for computing transition rates in
Wheeler's superspace. This is then applied to computing decays in flat space
and then to transitions in the presence of gravity. In the latter case we point
out the complexities arising from having non-positive definite kinetic terms
illustrating them in the simplified context of mini-superspace. This
corresponds to a generalisation of the well-known `tunneling from nothing'
scenarios. While we can obtain the leading term for the transitions obtained by
Euclidean methods we also point out some differences and ambiguities. We show
that there is no obstruction to keeping the spherically ($SO(4)$) symmetric
closed slicing for the new vacuum after a de Sitter to de Sitter transition. We
argue that this is the natural Lorentzian realisation of the Coleman-De Luccia
instanton and that a closed universe is also obtained if the mini-superspace
assumption is relaxed. This is contrary to the open universe predicted by
Coleman-De Luccia which relies on an analytic continuation performed after
bubble nucleation. Our findings may have important cosmological implications
related to the origin of inflation and to the string landscape. In particular,
they question the widespread belief that evidence for a closed universe would
rule out the string landscape.
