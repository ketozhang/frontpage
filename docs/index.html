          <p>We study the impact of different galaxy statistics and empirical metallicity
scaling relations on the merging rates and on the properties of compact objects
binaries. First, we analyze the similarities and differences of using the star
formation rate functions or the stellar mass functions as galaxy statistics for
the computation of the cosmic star formation rate density. Then we investigate
the effects of adopting the Fundamental Metallicity Relation or a classic Mass
Metallicity Relation to assign metallicity to galaxies with given properties.
We find that when the Fundamental Metallicity Relation is exploited, the bulk
of the star formation occurs at relatively high metallicities even at high
redshift; the opposite holds when the Mass Metallicity Relation is employed,
since in this case the metallicity at which most of the star formation takes
place strongly decreases with redshift. We discuss the various reasons and
possible biases originating this discrepancy. Finally, we show the impact that
these different astrophysical prescriptions have on the merging rates and on
the properties of compact objects binaries; specifically, we present results
for the redshift dependent merging rates and for the chirp mass and time delay
distributions of the merging binaries.

          <p>Strong gravitational lensing provides a wealth of astrophysical information
on the baryonic and dark matter content of galaxies. It also serves as a
valuable cosmological probe by allowing us to measure the Hubble constant
independently of other methods. These applications all require the difficult
task of inverting the lens equation and simultaneously reconstructing the mass
profile of the lens along with the original light profile of the unlensed
source. As there is no reason for either the lens or the source to be simple,
we need methods that both invert the lens equation with a large number of
degrees of freedom and also enforce a well-controlled regularisation that
avoids the appearance of spurious structures. This can be beautifully
accomplished by representing signals in wavelet space. Building on the Sparse
Lens Inversion Technique (SLIT), in this work we present an improved
sparsity-based method that describes lensed sources using wavelets and
optimises over the parameters given an analytical lens mass profile. We apply
our technique on simulated HST and E-ELT data, as well as on real HST images of
lenses from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample, assuming a lens model. We show
that wavelets allow us to reconstruct lensed sources containing detailed
substructures when using both present-day data and high-resolution images from
future thirty-meter-class telescopes. Wavelets moreover provide a much more
tractable solution in terms of quality and computation time compared to using a
source model that combines smooth analytical profiles and shapelets. Requiring
very little human interaction, our pixel-based technique fits into the effort
to devise automated modelling schemes. It can be incorporated in the standard
workflow of sampling analytical lens model parameters. The method, which we
call SLITronomy, is freely available as a new plug-in to the modelling software
Lenstronomy.

          <p>We explicitly construct a double field inflationary model, which satisfies
the latest PLANCK constraints at the CMB scales and produces the whole dark
matter energy density as primordial black holes (PBHs), in the mass range
$10^{-17}~M_{\odot}\lesssim M_{{}_{\rm PBH}}\lesssim 10^{-13}~M_{\odot}$. The
PBHs are produced after the end of slow-roll inflation from the bubbles of true
vacuum that nucleate during the course of inflation. Obtaining PBHs in this
mass range enforces the scale of inflation to be extremely low, $10^{-7}~{\rm
GeV}\lesssim H \lesssim 10^{-3} ~{\rm GeV}$, which makes the efforts to observe
gravitational waves at the CMB scales futile. However, it is high enough to
allow for a successful Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Instead, exit from the
rolling metastable direction to the true vacuum of the potential {\it may}
happen with a first-order phase transition (PT) that leaves behind a stochastic
gravitational wave background (SGWB), which is potentially observable by LISA.
We show that PBHs produced during such a first-order PT from the collision of
bubble walls contribute negligibly to the PBH mass spectrum. Examining the mass
distribution of PBHs and possible SGWB from the end of inflation, we may be
able to gain invaluable information about the topography of the landscape in
our neighborhood.

          <p>The diffuse extragalactic background light (EBL) is formed by ultraviolet
(UV), optical, and infrared (IR) photons mainly produced by star formation
processes over the history of the Universe, and contains essential information
about galaxy evolution and cosmology. Here, we present a new determination of
the evolving EBL spectral energy distribution using a novel approach purely
based on galaxy data aiming to reduce current uncertainties on the higher
redshifts and IR intensities. Our calculations use multiwavelength observations
from the UV to the far-IR of a sample of approximately 150,000 galaxies
detected up to $z\sim 6$ in the five fields of the Cosmic Assembly
Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) from the Hubble Space
Telescope. This is one of the most comprehensive and deepest multi-wavelength
galaxy datasets ever obtained. These unprecedented resources allow us to derive
the overall EBL evolution up to $z\sim 6$ and its uncertainties. Our results
agree with cosmic observables estimated from galaxy surveys and $\gamma$-ray
attenuation such as monochromatic luminosity densities, including those in the
far-IR, and star formation rate densities, also at the highest redshits.
Optical depths from our EBL approximation, which will be robust at high
redshifts and for $\gamma$ rays up to tens of TeV, will be reported in a
companion paper.

explain the dark matter abundance by the primordial black holes (PBHs)
estimated from the gravitational waves detections via the LIGO detectors. We
have indicated that the PBHs merger rate within each halo for the ellipsoidal
models is more significant than for the spherical models. We have specified
that the PBHs merger rate per unit time and per unit volume for the ellipsoidal
collapse halo models is about one order of magnitude higher than the
corresponding spherical models. Moreover, we have calculated the evolution of
the PBHs total merger rate as a function of redshift. The results indicate that
the evolution for the ellipsoidal halo models is more sensitive than spherical
halo models, as expected from the models. Finally, we have presented a
constraint on the PBHs abundance within the context of ellipsoidal and
spherical models. By comparing the results with the LIGO sensitivity window, we
have shown that the merger rate in the ellipsoidal collapse halo models enters
in the window for the PBHs fraction around $0.1$, and hence, reinforces the
multi-components scenario of dark matter.

          <p>A keV-scale gravitino arsing from a minimal supersymmetric (SUSY) Standard
Model (MSSM) is an interesting possibility since the small scale problems that
$\Lambda$CDM model encounters in the modern cosmology could be alleviated with
the keV-scale gravitino serving as the warm dark matter (WDM). Such a light
gravitino asks for a low scale supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking for which the
gauge mediation (GM) is required as a consistent SUSY-breaking mediation
mechanism. In this paper, we show upperbounds of the masses of the second
CP-even Higgs boson $H$ and the CP-odd Higgs boson $A$, assuming the keV-scale
gravitino to be responsible for the current DM relic abundance: the upperbound
on the mass of $H/A$ is found to be $\sim 4$ TeV for the gravitino mass of
$\mathcal{O}(10$-$100)$ keV. Interestingly, the mass of $H/A$ can be as small
as 2-3 TeV and the predicted $\tan\beta$ is as large as 55-60 for the gravitino
mass of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ keV. This will be tested in the near future Large

predict the redshift-space galaxy overdensity at the field level given a
realization of the initial conditions. We find that the residual noise between
the model and simulated galaxy density has a power spectrum that is white on
large scales, with size comparable to the shot noise. In the mildly nonlinear
regime, we see a $k^2\mu^2$ correction to the noise power spectrum,
corresponding to larger noise along the line of sight and on smaller scales.
The parametric form of this correction has been predicted on theoretical
grounds before, and our simulations provide important confirmation of its
presence. We have also modeled the galaxy velocity at the field-level and
compared it against simulated galaxy velocities, finding that about $10\%$ of

          <p>Observations of gamma-ray bursts up to $z\sim 9$ are best suited to study the
possible evolution of the Universe equation of state at intermediate redshifts.
We apply the Combo-relation to a sample of 174 gamma ray bursts to investigate
possible evidence of evolving dark energy parameter $w(z)$. We first build a
gamma ray burst Hubble's diagram and then we estimate the set ($\Omega_m$,
$\Omega_{\Lambda}$) in the framework of flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM
paradigm. We then get bounds over the $w$CDM model, where $w$ is thought to
evolve with redshift, adopting two priors over the Hubble constant in tension
at $4.4$-$\sigma$, i.e. $H_0=(67.4\pm0.5)$ km/s/Mpc and $H_0=(74.03\pm1.42)$
km/s/Mpc. We show our new sample provides tighter constraints on $\Omega_m$
since at $z\leq1.2$ we see that $w(z)$ agrees within 1$\sigma$ with the
standard value $w=-1$. The situation is the opposite at larger $z$, where gamma
ray bursts better fix $w(z)$ that seems to deviate from $w=-1$ at $2$-$\sigma$
and $4$-$\sigma$ level, depending on the redshift bins. In particular, we
investigate the $w(z)$ evolution through a piecewise formulation over seven
redshift intervals. From our fitting procedure we show that at $z\geq 1.2$ the
case $w&lt;-1$ cannot be fully excluded, indicating that dark energy's influence
is not negligible at larger $z$. We confirm the Combo relation as a powerful
tool to investigate cosmological evolution of dark energy. Future space
missions will significantly enrich the gamma ray burst database even at smaller
redshifts, improving de facto the results discussed in this paper.

          <p>There are strong interests in considering ultra-light scalar fields
(especially axion) around a rapidly rotating black hole because of the
possibility of observing gravitational waves from axion condensate (axion
cloud) around black holes. Motivated by this consideration, we propose a new
method to study the dynamics of an ultra-light scalar field with
self-interaction around a rapidly rotating black hole, which uses the dynamical
renormalization group method. We find that for relativistic clouds, saturation
of the superradiant instability by the scattering of the axion due to the
self-interaction does not occur in the weakly non-linear regime when we
consider the adiabatic growth of the cloud from a single superradiant mode.
This may suggest that for relativistic axion clouds, an explosive phenomenon

          <p>We develop a method to identify cosmic voids from the matter density field by
adopting a physically-motivated concept that voids are the counterpart of
massive clusters. To prove the concept we use a pair of $\Lambda$CDM
simulations, a reference and its initial density-inverted mirror simulation,
and study the relation between the effective size of voids and the mass of
corresponding clusters. Galaxy cluster-scale dark matter halos are identified
in the Mirror simulation at $z=0$ by linking dark matter particles. The void
corresponding to each cluster is defined in the Reference simulation as the
region occupied by the member particles of the cluster. We study the voids
corresponding to the halos more massive than $10^{13}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. We find
a power-law scaling relation between the void size and the corresponding
cluster mass. Voids with corresponding cluster mass above
$10^{15}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ occupy $\sim1\%$ of the total simulated volume,
whereas this fraction increases to $\sim54\%$ for voids with corresponding
cluster mass above $10^{13}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. It is also found that the density
profile of the identified voids follows a universal functional form. Based on
these findings, we propose a method to identify cluster-counterpart voids
directly from the matter density field without their mirror information by
utilizing three parameters such as the smoothing scale, density threshold, and
minimum core fraction. We recover voids corresponding to clusters more massive
than $3\times10^{14}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ at 70--74 \% level of completeness and
reliability. Our results suggest that we are able to identify voids in a way to
associate them with clusters of a particular mass-scale.

large fraction of the whole DM can reside in these collapsed objects that

consequently possess higher densities than those in the conventional scenarios

          <p>In the context of tomographic cosmic shear surveys, a theoretical model for
the one-point statistics of the aperture mass (Map) is developed. This
formalism is based on the application of the large deviation principle to the
projected matter density field and more specifically to the angular aperture
masses. The latter holds the advantage of being an observable that can be
directly extracted from the observed shear field and to be, by construction,
independent from the long wave modes. Furthermore we show that, with the help
of a nulling procedure based on the so-called BNT transform, it is possible to
build observables that depend only on a finite range of redshifts making them
also independent from the small-scale modes. This procedure makes predictions
for the shape of the one-point Probability Distribution Function of such an
observable very accurate, comparable to what had been previously obtained for
3D observables. Comparisons with specific simulations reveal however
inconsistent results showing that synthetic lensing maps were not accurate
enough for such refined observables. It points to the need for more precise
dedicated numerical developments whose performances could be benchmarked with
such observables. We furthermore review the possible systematics that could
affect such a formalism in future weak-lensing surveys like Euclid, notably the
impact of shape noise as well as leading corrections coming from lens-lens
couplings, geodesic deviation, reduced shear and magnification bias.

          <p>In the local Universe, there is a handful of dwarf compact star-forming
galaxies with extremely low oxygen abundances. It has been proposed that they
are young, having formed a large fraction of their stellar mass during their
last few hundred Myr. However, little is known about the fraction of young
stellar populations in more massive galaxies. In a previous article, we
analyzed 280 000 SDSS spectra to identify a surprisingly large sample of more
massive Very Young Galaxies (VYGs), defined to have formed at least $50\%$ of
their stellar mass within the last 1 Gyr. Here, we investigate in detail the
properties of a subsample of 207 galaxies that are VYGs according to all three
of our spectral models. We compare their properties with those of control
sample galaxies (CSGs). We find that VYGs tend to have higher surface
brightness and to be more compact, dusty, asymmetric, and clumpy than CSGs.
Analysis of a subsample with HI detections reveals that VYGs are more gas-rich
than CSGs. VYGs tend to reside more in the inner parts of low-mass groups and
are twice as likely to be interacting with a neighbour galaxy than CSGs. On the
other hand, VYGs and CSGs have similar gas metallicities and large scale
environments (relative to filaments and voids). These results suggest that
gas-rich interactions and mergers are the main mechanisms responsible for the
recent triggering of star formation in low-redshift VYGs, except for the lowest
mass VYGs, where the starbursts may arise from a mixture of mergers and gas
infall.

distribution function and the Galactic potential, fully taking into account the
survey selection function, the observational errors, and the missing
line-of-sight velocity data for RR Lyrae stars. With a Bayesian MCMC method, we
infer the model parameters, including the density flattening of the DM halo
$q$, which is assumed to be constant as a function of radius. We find that 99\%
of the posterior distribution of $q$ is located at $q&gt;0.963$, which strongly
disfavours a flattened DM halo. We cannot draw any conclusions as to whether
the Galactic DM halo at $r \lesssim 30$ kpc is prolate, because we restrict
ourselves to axisymmetric oblate halo models with $q\leq1$. Our result is
inconsistent with predictions from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that
advocate more oblate ($\langle{q}\rangle \sim0.8 \pm 0.15$) DM halos within
$\sim 15\%$ of the virial radius for Milky-Way-sized galaxies. An alternative
possibility, based on our validation tests with a cosmological simulation, is
that the true value $q$ of the Galactic halo could be consistent with
cosmological simulations but that disequilibrium in the Milky Way potential is
inflating our measurement of $q$ by 0.1-0.2. As a by-product of our analysis,
our model constrains the DM density in the Solar neighbourhood to be

          <p>Inflationary models including vector fields have attracted a great deal of
attention over the past decade. Such an interest owes to the fact that they
might contribute to, or even be fully responsible for, the curvature
perturbation imprinted in the CMB. However, the necessary breaking of the
vector field's conformal invariance during inflation is not without problems.
In recent years it has been realized that a number of instabilities endangering
the consistency of the theory arise when the conformal invariance is broken by
means of a non-minimal coupling to gravity. In this paper we consider a massive
vector field non-minimally coupled to gravity through the Gauss-Bonnet
invariant, and investigate whether the vector can obtain a nearly
scale-invariant perturbation spectrum while evading the emergence of
perturbative instabilities. We find that the strength of the coupling must be
extremely small if the vector field is to have a chance to contribute to the
total curvature perturbation.

          <p>We compute the covariance of the galaxy power spectrum multipoles in
perturbation theory, including the effects of nonlinear evolution, nonlinear
and nonlocal bias, radial redshift-space distortions, arbitrary survey window
and shot noise. We rewrite the power spectrum FKP estimator in terms of the
usual windowed galaxy fluctuations and the fluctuations in the number of
galaxies inside the survey volume. We show that this leads to a stronger
super-sample covariance than assumed in the literature and causes a substantial
leakage of Gaussian information. We decompose the covariance matrix into
several contributions that provide an insight into its behavior for different
biased tracers. We show that for realistic surveys, the covariance of power
spectrum multipoles is already dominated by shot noise and super survey mode
coupling in the weakly non-linear regime. Both these effects can be accurately
modeled analytically, making a perturbative treatment of the covariance very
compelling. Our method allows for the covariance to be varied as a function of
cosmology and bias parameters very efficiently, with survey geometry entering
as fixed kernels that can be computed separately using fast fourier transforms
(FFTs). We find excellent agreement between our analytic covariance and that
estimated from BOSS DR12 Patchy mock catalogs in the whole range we tested, up

redshift range (0 &lt; z &lt; 4). Results presented here inform an example
'prescription' that can be applied as a realistic photometric redshift
estimation scenario for a hypothetical large-scale survey. We find that with
appropriate optimization, we can identify a large percentage (&gt;30%) of
catastrophic outlier galaxies while simultaneously incorrectly flagging only a
small percentage (&lt;7% and in many cases &lt;3%) of non-outlier galaxies as
catastrophic outliers. We find also that our training set redshift distribution
modification results in a significant decrease (&gt;10%) in the percentage of
outlier galaxies greater than z = 1.5 with only a small increase (&lt;3%) in the
percentage of outlier galaxies less than z = 1.5 compared to the unmodified
training set. In addition, we find that this modification can in some cases
decrease the percentage of incorrectly identified non-outlier galaxies by
almost 20%, while in other cases cause only a small (&lt;1%) increase in this
metric.

          <p>Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) provide a robust standard ruler, and can
be used to constrain the expansion history of the Universe at low redshift.
Standard BAO analyses return a model-independent measurement of the expansion
rate and the comoving angular diameter distance as function of redshift,
normalized by the sound horizon at radiation drag. However, this methodology
relies on anisotropic distance distortions of a fixed, pre-computed template
(obtained in a given fiducial cosmology) in order to fit the observations.
Therefore, it may be possible that extensions to the consensus $\Lambda$CDM add
contributions to the BAO feature that cannot be captured by the template
fitting. We perform mock BAO fits to power spectra computed assuming
cosmological models which modify the growth of perturbations prior to
recombination in order to test the robustness of the standard BAO analysis. We
find no significant bias in the BAO analysis for the models under study
($\Lambda$CDM with a free effective number of relativistic species, early dark
energy, and a model with interactions between neutrinos and a fraction of the
dark matter), even for cases which do not provide a good fit to \textit{Planck}
measurements of the cosmic microwave background power spectra. This result
supports the use of the standard BAO analysis and its measurements to perform
cosmological parameter inference and to constrain exotic models. In addition,
we provide a methodology to reproduce our study for different models and
surveys, as well as discuss different options to handle eventual biases in the
BAO measurements.

          <p>Strong lensing of gravitational waves is more likely for distant sources but
predicted event rates are highly uncertain with many astrophysical origins
proposed. Here we open a new avenue to estimate the event rate of strongly
lensed systems by exploring the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational wave
background (SGWB). This method can provide a direct upper bound on the high
redshift binary coalescing rates, which can be translated into an upper bound
on the expected rate of strongly lensed systems. We show that from the ongoing
analysis of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory

bounds on the lensing event rate can be imposed using the SGWB signal.
Combining measurements of loud gravitational wave events with an unresolved
stochastic background detection will improve estimates of the numbers of lensed
events at high redshift. The proposed method is going to play a crucial in
understanding the population of lensed and unlensed systems from gravitational

explore whether surface brightness dimming (SBD) of the [CII] line is
responsible for the reported [CII] deficit, and the large $L_{\rm
[OIII]}/L_{\rm [CII]}$ luminosity ratio measured in early galaxies. We first
analyse archival ALMA images of nine z&gt;6 galaxies observed in both [CII] and
[OIII]. After performing several uv-tapering experiments to optimize the
identification of extended line emission, we detect [CII] emission in the whole
sample, with an extent systematically larger than the [CII] emission. Next, we
use interferometric simulations to study the effect of SBD on the line
luminosity estimate. About 40% of the extended [CII] component might be missed
at an angular resolution of 0.8$^{\prime\prime}$, implying that $L_{\rm [CII]}$
is underestimated by a factor $\approx2$ in data at low (&lt;7) signal-to-noise

galaxies lies, on average, slightly below the local $L_{\rm [CII]}-SFR$

          <p>Typical cosmological models are based on the postulate that the universe is
homogeneous and isotropic in its spatial dimensions. Space is however not
perfectly homogeneous, and contains overdense regions in which matter is
concentrating, leaving other underdense regions of almost void. The evolution
of the scale factor of the universe has been established from measurements on
SNIa. Since such events occur in regions were matter is present, we may expect
that most of the SNIa that have been observed are located in overdense regions.
This means that the evolution of the scale factor has been established in a
biased manner, by considering only information coming from these overdense
regions, and excluding the one from the underdense regions. We develop in this
article a simple model to analyse the effect of this bias, and show that it
leads to the appearance of a new tensor in the Einstein equation of general
relativity, which can account for the apparent acceleration of the expansion of
the universe. We further show that this tensor tends to be proportional to the
metric tensor, and that the constant of proportionality quantitatively
corresponds to the measured cosmological constant with a remarkable accuracy.

          <p>Cosmological simulations of reionization often treat radiative transfer by
solving for the monopole and dipoles of the intensity field and by making
ansatz for the quadrupole moments to close the system of equations. We
investigate the accuracy of the most common closure methods, i.e. Eddington
tensor choices. We argue that these algorithms are most likely to err after
reionization and study quasi-analytic test problems mimicking these situations:
large-scale post-reionization ionizing background fluctuations and radiative
transfer in a predominantly ionized medium with discrete absorbers. We show
that OTVET and M1 over-ionize self-shielding absorbers when fixing the
background photoionization rate, leading to 30-40% higher emissivity to balance
the increased recombination. This over-ionization results in a simulation run
with these algorithms having a factor of ~2 lower average metagalactic
photoionization rate relative to truth given an ionizing emissivity.
Furthermore, these algorithms are unlikely to reproduce ionizing background
fluctuations on scales below the photon mean path: OTVET tends to overpredict
the fluctuations there when the simulation box is smaller than twice the mean
free path and underpredict otherwise, while M1 drastically underpredicts these
fluctuations. As a result, these numerical methods are likely not sufficiently
accurate to interpret the Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity fluctuations observed after
reionzation. We show that a high number of angular directions need to be
followed to capture the post-reionization ionizing background fluctuations
accurately with ray-tracing codes. Lastly, we argue that the strong dependence
of the post-reionization ionizing background on the value of the reduced speed
of light found in many simulations signals that the ionizing photon mean free
path is several times larger in such simulations than the observationally
measured value.

been largely ignored. In this paper we study the impact of object detection for
a Euclid-like survey and show that it leads to biases that exceed requirements

blending of galaxies is an important source of detection bias. We find that
MetaDetection is able to account for blending, leading to average
multiplicative biases that meet requirements for Stage IV surveys, provided a

          <p>We present a study of the 1173 sources brighter than $S_{1.4\,\rm GHz}=
120\,\mu$Jy detected over an area of $\simeq 1.4\,\hbox{deg}^{2}$ in the
Lockman Hole field. Exploiting the multi-band information available in this
field for $\sim$79% of the sample, sources have been classified into radio loud
(RL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs), star forming galaxies (SFGs) and radio
quiet (RQ) AGNs, using a variety of diagnostics available in the literature.
Exploiting the observed tight anti-correlations between IRAC band 1 or band 2
and the source redshift we could assign a redshift to 177 sources missing a
spectroscopic measurement or a reliable photometric estimate. A Monte Carlo
approach was used to take into account the spread around the mean relation. The
derived differential number counts and luminosity functions at several
redshifts of each population show a good consistency with models and with
earlier estimates made using data from different surveys and applying different
approaches. Our results confirm that below $\sim300\,\mu$Jy SFGs$+$RQ AGNs
overtake RL AGNs that dominate at brighter flux densities. We also confirm
earlier indications of a similar evolution of RQ AGNs and SFGs. Finally, we
discuss the angular correlation function of our sources and highlight its
sensitivity to the criteria used for the classification.

          <p>We study two key issues militating against the use of the anisotropic
three-point correlation function (3PCF) for cosmological parameter inference:
difficulties with its computational estimation and high-dimensionality. We show
how high-dimensionality may be reduced significantly by multipole
decompositions of all angular dependence. This allows deriving the full
expression for the multipole moments of the anisotropic 3PCF and its covariance
matrix in a basis where the dimensionality reduces from nine to two at each
multipole in the plane-parallel limit. We use 2D FFTLog formalism to show how
the multipole moments with double momentum integrals over the product of
bispectrum and two highly oscillating spherical Bessel functions and its
covariance with double momentum integrals over the product of three galaxy
power spectra and a combination of four highly oscillating spherical Bessel
functions may be computed optimally.

        <strong>The effect of redshift degeneracy and the damping effect of viscous medium on the information extracted from gravitational wave signals. (arXiv:2011.09169v2 [astro-ph.CO] UPDATED)</strong>

          <p>Considering the cosmological redshift $z_c$ , the mass of GW source extracted
from GW signal is $1+z_c$ times larger than its intrinsic value, and distance
between detector and GW source should be regarded as luminosity distance.
However, besides cosmological redshift, there are other kinds of redshifts
should be considered, which is actually ignored, in the analysis of GW data,
such as Doppler redshift and gravitational redshift, so the parameters
extracted from GW may deviate from their intrinsic values. Another factor that
may affect GW is the viscous medium in propagation path of GW, which may damp
the GW with a damping rate of $16{\pi}G{\eta}$. Some studies indicate dark
matter may interact with each other, thus dark matter may be the origin of
viscosity of cosmic medium. Then the GW may be rapidly damped by the viscous
medium that is made of dark matter, such as dark matter "mini-spike" around
intermediate mass black hole. In this article, we mainly discuss how Doppler
and gravitational redshift, together with the damping effect of viscous medium,
affect the information, such as the mass and redshift of GW source, extracted
from GW signals.
