          <p>Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are massive black holes (BHs) caught in the act
of accreting gas at the centre of their host galaxies. Part of the accreting
mass is converted to energy and released into the surrounding medium, in a
process loosely referred to as AGN feedback. Most numerical simulations include
AGN feedback as a sub-grid model, wherein energy or momentum (or both) is
coupled to the nearby gas. In this work, we implement a new momentum-driven
model in the hydrodynamics code GIZMO, in which accretion from large scales is
mediated by a sub-grid accretion disc model, and gas particles are
stochastically kicked over a bi-conical region, to mimic observed kinetic
winds. The feedback cone's axis can be set either parallel to the angular
momentum of the gas surrounding the BH or to the BH spin direction, which is
self-consistently evolved within the accretion-disc model. Using a
circumnuclear disc (CND) as a test bed, we find that (i) the conical shape of
the outflow is always visible and is weakly dependent on the launching
orientation and aperture, resulting in comparable mass inflows and outflows;
(ii) the cone's orientation is also similar amongst our tests, and it is not
always the same as the initial value, due to the interaction with the CND
playing a crucial role in shaping the outflow; and (iii) the velocity of the
outflow, instead, differs and strongly depends on the interplay with the CND.

          <p>We present a Bayesian method for estimating instrumental noise parameters and
propagating noise uncertainties within the global BeyondPlanck Gibbs sampling
framework, and apply this to Planck LFI time-ordered data. Following previous
literature, we adopt a simple $1/f$ model for the noise power spectral density
(PSD), and implement an optimal Wiener-filter (or constrained realization)
gap-filling procedure to account for masked data. We then use this procedure to
both estimate the gapless correlated noise in the time-domain,
$n_\mathrm{corr}$, and to sample the noise PSD spectral parameters, $\xi^n =
\{\sigma_0, f_\mathrm{knee}, \alpha\}$. In contrast to previous Planck
analyses, we only assume piecewise stationary noise within each pointing period
(PID), not throughout the full mission, but we adopt the LFI DPC results as
priors on $\alpha$ and $f_\mathrm{knee}$. On average, we find best-fit
correlated noise parameters that are mostly consistent with previous results,
with a few notable exceptions. However, a detailed inspection of the
time-dependent results reveals many important findings. First and foremost, we
find strong evidence for statistically significant temporal variations in all
noise PSD parameters, many of which are directly correlated with satellite
housekeeping data. Second, while the simple $1/f$ model appears to be an
excellent fit for the LFI 70 GHz channel, there is evidence for additional
correlated noise not described by a $1/f$ model in the 30 and 44 GHz channels,
including within the primary science frequency range of 0.1-1 Hz. In general,
most 30 and 44 GHz channels exhibit excess noise at the 2-$3 \sigma$ level in
each one hour pointing period. For some periods of time, we also find evidence
of strong common mode noise fluctuations across the entire focal plane.

          <p>A distance-deviation consistency and model-independent method to test the
cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) is provided. The method is worth
attention on two aspects: firstly, a distance-deviation consistency method is
used to pair subsamples: instead of pairing subsamples with redshift deviation
smaller than a \textbf{value}, say $\left\vert \Delta z\right\vert &lt;0.005$. The
redshift deviation between subsamples decreases with the redshift to ensure the
distance deviation stays the same. The method selects more subsamples at high
redshift, up to $z=2.16$, and provides 120 subsample pairs. Secondly, the
model-independent method involves the latest data set of $1048$ type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) and $205$ strong gravitational lensing systems (SGLS),
which are used to obtain the luminosity distances $D_L$ and the ratio of
angular diameter distance $D_A$ respectively. With the model-independent
method, parameters of the CDDR, the SNe Ia light-curve, and the SGLS are fitted
simultaneously. \textbf{The result shows} that $\eta = 0.047^{+0.190}_{-0.151}$
and CDDR is validated at 1$\sigma$ confidence level for the form
$\frac{{{D_L}}}{{{D_A}}}{(1 + z)^{ - 2}} =1+ \eta z$.

          <p>Galaxies and clusters embedded in the large-scale structure of the Universe
are observed to align in preferential directions. Galaxy alignment has been
established as a potential probe for cosmological information, but the
application of cluster alignments for these purposes remains unexplored.
Clusters are observed to have a higher alignment amplitude than galaxies, but
because galaxies are much more numerous, the trade-off in detectability between
the two signals remains unclear. We present forecasts comparing cluster and
galaxy alignments for two extragalactic survey set-ups: a currently-available
low redshift survey (SDSS) and an upcoming higher redshift survey (LSST). For
SDSS, we rely on the publicly available redMaPPer catalogue to describe the
cluster sample. For LSST, we perform estimations of the expected number counts
while we extrapolate the alignment measurements from SDSS. Clusters in SDSS
have typically higher alignment signal-to-noise than galaxies. For LSST, the
cluster alignment signals quickly wash out with redshift due to a relatively
low number count and a decreasing alignment amplitude. Nevertheless, a
potential strong-suit of clusters is in their interplay with weak lensing:
intrinsic alignments can be more easily isolated for clusters than for
galaxies. The signal-to-noise of cluster alignment can in general be improved
by isolating close pairs along the line of sight.

          <p>Within the landscape of modified theories of gravity, progress in
understanding the behaviour of, and developing tests for, screening mechanisms
has been hindered by the complexity of the field equations involved, which are
nonlinear in nature and characterised by a large hierarchy of scales. This is
especially true of Vainshtein screening, where the fifth force is suppressed by
high-order derivative terms which dominate within a radius much larger than the
size of the source, known as the Vainshtein radius.

<p>In this work, we present the numerical code $\varphi$enics, building on the

interest for screening: a model containing high-order derivative operators in
the equation of motion and one characterised by nonlinear self-interactions in
two coupled scalar fields. We are also able to compute higher-order operators
of the scalar fields in post-processing. These two examples illustrate the
different challenges experienced when trying to simulate such theories
numerically, and we show how these are addressed within this code. This article
therefore also provides a worked example of how the finite element method can
be employed to solve the screened equations of motion. $\varphi$enics is
publicly available and can be adapted to solve other theories of screening.

similar to what happens to the cosmological constant in the unimodular gravity
where the trace part of the Einstein equations is lost in a different way. We
introduce a constrained variational formulation of these modified Einstein

unimodular gravity, we construct different general-covariant actions resulting
in these dynamics. The inverse of dynamical Newton constant is canonically
conjugated to the Ricci scalar integrated over spacetime. Surprisingly, instead
of the dynamical Newton constant one can formulate an equivalent theory with a

          <p>We study the spin of primordial black holes produced by the collapse of large
inhomogeneities in the early universe. Since such primordial black holes
originate from peaks, that is, from maxima of the local overdensity, we resort
to peak theory to obtain the probability distribution of the spin at formation.
We show that the spin is a first-order effect in perturbation theory: it
results from the action of first-order tidal gravitational fields generating
first-order torques upon horizon-crossing, and from the asphericity of the
collapsing object. Assuming an ellipsoidal shape, the typical value of the
dimensionless parameter $a_{\rm s}=S/G_N M^2$, where $S$ is the spin and $M$ is
the mass of the primordial black hole, is about
$\sigma_\delta\sqrt{1-\gamma^2}/2\pi$. Here, $\sigma^2_\delta$ is the variance
of the overdensity at horizon crossing and the parameter $\gamma$ is a measure
of the width of the power spectrum giving rise to primordial black holes. One
has $\gamma=1$ for monochromatic spectra. For these narrow spectra, the
suppression arises because the velocity shear, which is strongly correlated
with the inertia tensor, tends to align with the principal axis frame of the
collapsing object. Typical values of $a_{\rm s}$ are at the percent level.

uniform trace-free tidal field up to wavenumber $k = 7 h \text{Mpc}^{-1}$.
Together with the response to a large-scale overdensity measured in previous
work, this completely describes the nonlinear matter bispectrum in the squeezed

scales in physical coordinates, but rather a constant value at $z=0$,
$R_K\approx 0.5$ for $k \geq 3 h\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ up to the scale where we
consider our simulations reliable, $k \leq 7 h\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=0$. This
shows that even the inner regions of haloes are affected by the large-scale

inequalities except that, instead of changing the direction of the polariser at

relying on position measurements only. This is particularly useful in
experimental setups where the momentum direction cannot be probed (such as in
cosmology for instance). We study these bipartite temporal Bell inequalities
for continuous systems placed in two-mode squeezed states, and find some
regions in parameter space where they are indeed violated. We highlight the
role played by the rotation angle, which is one of the three parameters
characterising a two-mode squeezed state (the other two being the squeezing
amplitude and the squeezing angle). In single-time measurements, it only
determines the overall phase of the wavefunction and can therefore be
discarded, but in multiple-time measurements, its time dynamics becomes

cosmological parameters, it does provide a three-way consistency check among
the lensing inferred from the best-fit parameters, the lensing in the CMB power

$M &gt; 10^{-9}\,M_{\odot}$ and $m_{\chi} &gt;10\,$GeV. There is a region of
parameter space, with $M \lesssim 10^{-11}\,M_{\odot}$ and $m_{\chi} \lesssim
100\,$GeV, in which WIMPs and PBHs can both provide some but not all of the DM,
so that one requires a third DM candidate.

        <strong>SDSS-IV MaNGA: Modeling the Spectral Line Spread Function to Sub-Percent Accuracy. (arXiv:2011.04675v2 [astro-ph.IM] UPDATED)</strong>

          <p>The SDSS-IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) program has been operating
from 2014-2020, and has now observed a sample of 9,269 galaxies in the low
redshift universe (z ~ 0.05) with integral-field spectroscopy. With
rest-optical (\lambda\lambda 0.36 - 1.0 um) spectral resolution R ~ 2000 the
instrumental spectral line-spread function (LSF) typically has 1sigma width of
about 70 km/s, which poses a challenge for the study of the typically 20-30
km/s velocity dispersion of the ionized gas in present-day disk galaxies. In
this contribution, we present a major revision of the MaNGA data pipeline
architecture, focusing particularly on a variety of factors impacting the
effective LSF (e.g., undersampling, spectral rectification, and data cube
construction). Through comparison with external assessments of the MaNGA data
provided by substantially higher-resolution R ~ 10,000 instruments we
demonstrate that the revised MPL-10 pipeline measures the instrumental line
spread function sufficiently accurately (&lt;= 0.6% systematic, 2% random around
the wavelength of Halpha) that it enables reliable measurements of
astrophysical velocity dispersions sigma_Halpha ~ 20 km/s for spaxels with
emission lines detected at SNR &gt; 50. Velocity dispersions derived from [O II],
Hbeta, [O III], [N II], and [S II] are consistent with those derived from
Halpha to within about 2% at sigma_Halpha &gt; 30 km/s. Although the impact of
these changes to the estimated LSF will be minimal at velocity dispersions
greater than about 100 km/s, scientific results from previous data releases
that are based on dispersions far below the instrumental resolution should be
reevaulated.
