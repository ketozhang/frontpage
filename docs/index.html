          <p>Radio synchrotron emission from the bridges of low-density gas connecting
galaxy clusters and groups is a challenge for particle acceleration processes.
In this work, we analyse the Coma radio bridge using new LOw Frequency ARray
(LOFAR) observations at 144 MHz. LOFAR detects the bridge and its substructures
with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. We find that the radio emission
peaks on the NGC 4839 group. Towards the halo, in front of the NGC 4839 group,
the radio brightness decreases and streams of radio emission connect the NGC
4839 group to the radio relic. Using X-ray observations, we find that thermal
and non-thermal plasma are moderately correlated with a sub-linear scaling. We
use archival radio data at 326 MHz to constrain the spectral index in the
bridge, and quantify the distribution of particles and magnetic field at
different frequencies. We find that the spectrum is steeper than $-1.4 \pm
0.2$, and that the emission could be clumpier at 326 MHz than at 144 MHz. Using
cosmological simulations and a simplified approach to compute particle
acceleration, we derive under which conditions turbulent acceleration of mildly
relativistic electrons could generate the radio emission in the bridge.
Assuming that the initial energy ratio of the seed electrons is $3 \cdot
10^{-4}$ with respect to the thermal gas, we are able to reproduce the observed
luminosity. Our results suggest that the seed electrons released by
radiogalaxies in the bridge and the turbulence generated by the motion of gas
and galaxies are essential to produce the radio emission.

          <p>We derive a simple prescription for including beyond-linear halo bias within
the standard, analytical halo-model power spectrum calculation. This results in
a corrective term that is added to the usual two-halo term. We measure this
correction using data from $N$-body simulations and demonstrate that it can
boost power in the two-halo term by a factor of $\sim2$ at scales $k\sim0.7\,h
Mpc^{-1}$, with the exact magnitude of the boost determined by the specific
pair of fields in the two-point function. How this translates to the full power
spectrum depends on the relative strength of the one-halo term, which can mask
the importance of this correction to a greater or lesser degree, again
depending on the fields. Generally we find that our correction is more
important for signals that arise from lower-mass haloes. When comparing our
calculation to simulated data we find that the under-prediction of power in the
transition region between the two- and one-halo terms, which typically plagues
halo-model calculations, is almost completely eliminated when including the
full non-linear halo bias. We show improved results for the auto and cross
spectra of galaxies, haloes and matter. In the specific case of matter-matter
or matter-halo power we note that a large fraction of the improvement comes
from the non-linear biasing between low- and high-mass haloes. We envisage our
model being useful in the analytical modelling of cross correlation signals.

        <strong>Constraints on the properties of warm dark matter using the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. (arXiv:2011.08865v1 [astro-ph.CO])</strong>

          <p>The satellite galaxies of the Milky Way (MW) are effective probes of the
underlying dark matter (DM) substructure, which is sensitive to the nature of
the DM particle. In particular, a class of DM models have a power spectrum
cut-off on the mass scale of dwarf galaxies and thus predict only small numbers
of substructures below the cut-off mass. This makes the MW satellite system
appealing to constrain the DM properties: feasible models must produce enough
substructure to host the number of observed Galactic satellites. Here, we
compare theoretical predictions of the abundance of DM substructure in thermal
relic warm DM (WDM) models with estimates of the total satellite population of
the MW. This produces conservative robust lower limits on the allowed mass,
$m_\mathrm{th}$, of the thermal relic WDM particle. As the abundance of
satellite galaxies depends on the MW halo mass, we marginalize over the
corresponding uncertainties and rule out $m_\mathrm{th} \leq 2.02\,
\mathrm{keV}$ at 95 per cent confidence independently of assumptions about
galaxy formation processes. Modelling some of these - in particular, the effect
of reionization, which suppresses the formation of dwarf galaxies - strengthens
our constraints on the DM properties and excludes models with $m_\mathrm{th}
\leq 3.99\, \mathrm{keV}$ in our fiducial model. We also find that thermal
relic models cannot produce enough satellites if the MW halo mass is
$M_{200}\leq 0.6\times 10^{12}\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$, which imposes a lower limit
on the MW halo mass in CDM. We address several observational and theoretical
uncertainties and discuss how improvements in these will strengthen the DM mass
constraints.

favorable momentum-dependence of the resulting scattering rate, which partially
compensates the unfavorable kinematics that tends to strongly suppress keV
electron recoils. We study the phenomenology of the mediator and identify the
allowed parameter space of the Xenon1T excess which is compatible with all

          <p>Understanding the Fe II emission from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has been a
grand challenge for many decades. The rewards from understanding the AGN
spectra would be immense, involving both quasar classification schemes such as
"Eigenvector 1" and tracing the chemical evolution of the cosmos. Recently,
three large Fe II atomic datasets with radiative and electron collisional rates
have become available. We have incorporated these into the spectral synthesis
code Cloudy and examine predictions using a new generation of AGN Spectral
Energy Distribution (SED), which indicates that the UV emission can be quite
different depending on the dataset utilized. The Smyth et al dataset better
reproduces the observed Fe II template of the I ZW 1 Seyfert galaxy in the UV
and optical regions, and we adopt these data. We consider both thermal and
microturbulent clouds and show that a microturbulence of $\approx$ 100 km/s
reproduces the observed shape and strength of the so-called Fe II "UV bump".
Comparing our predictions with the observed Fe II template, we derive a typical
cloud density of $10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ and photon flux of $10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$, and show that these largely reproduce the observed Fe II emission in
the UV and optical. We calculate the $I$(Fe II)/$I$(Mg II) emission-line
intensity ratio using our best-fitting model and obtain log($I$(Fe II)/$I$(Mg
II)) $\sim$ 0.7, suggesting many AGNs have a roughly solar Fe/Mg abundance
ratio. Finally, we vary the Eddington ratio and SED shape as a step in
understanding the Eigenvector 1 correlation.

of the Universe. They add just a singlet that only couples to the Higgs through
a single parameter that controls both the dark matter relic abundance and the
direct detection cross-section. Unfortunately this scenario, either with scalar
or fermionic dark matter, is almost ruled out by the latter. In this paper we
analyze the Higgs-portal idea with fermionic dark matter in the context of a

from those that control the direct detection cross section we are able to open

which is caused by the dissipation of the scalar field energy density into
relativistic degrees of freedom. The dissipation process has important
consequences for the evolution both at the levels of background as well as
perturbation and allows us to easily satisfy the observational constraints.~Our
numerical analysis confirms that the model conforms to observational
constraints even if the field-radiation coupling strength is weak. In the warm
background, we investigate the post inflationary evolution of relic gravity
waves produced during inflation whose amplitude is constrained by the Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis constraint. Further, we investigate the effect of coupling on
the amplitude of gravity waves and obtain the allowed phase space between the

blue spectrum of gravitational wave background at high frequencies. We discuss
the perspectives of detection of the signal of relic gravity waves by future

However, besides cosmological redshift, there are other kinds of redshifts

(CDMSlite) achieved efficient detection of very small recoil energies in its
germanium target, resulting in sensitivity to Lightly Ionizing Particles (LIPs)
in a previously unexplored region of charge, mass, and velocity parameter

cosmogenically-produced LIPs with an electric charge smaller than
$e/(3\times10^5)$, as well as the strongest limits for charge $\leq e/160$,
with a minimum vertical intensity of $1.36\times10^{-7}$

range of LIP masses (5 MeV/$c^2$ to 100 TeV/$c^2$) and cover a wide range of
$\beta\gamma$ values (0.1 -- $10^6$), thus excluding non-relativistic LIPs with

          <p>X-CIGALE, built upon the spectral energy distribution (SED) code of CIGALE,
implements important new features: The code accounts for obscuring material in
the polars of the AGN and has the ability to fit X-ray fluxes. In this work, we
use ~2500 spectroscopic, X-ray AGN from the XMM-XXL-North field and examine the
improvements the new features bring in the SED modelling analysis. Based on our
results, X-CIGALE successfully connects the X-ray with the UV luminosity in the
whole range spanned by our sample (log Lx(2-10 keV) = (42 - 46) erg/s). The
addition of the new features globally improves the efficiency of X-CIGALE in
the estimation and characterization of the AGN component. The classification
into type 1 and type 2 based on their inclination angle is improved, especially
at redshifts lower than 1. The statistical significance of the AGN fraction,
fracAGN, measurements is increased, in particular for luminous X-ray sources
(log LX &gt; 45 erg/s). These conclusions hold under the condition that (mid-) IR
photometry is available in the SED fitting process. The addition of polar dust
increases the AGN fraction and the efficiency of the SED decomposition to
detect AGN among X-ray selected sources. X-CIGALE estimates a strong AGN
(fracAGN &gt; 0.3) in more than 90% of the infrared selected AGN and 75% of X-ray
detected AGN not selected by IR colour criteria. The latter drops to ~50% when
polar dust is not included. The ability of X-CIGALE to include X-ray
information in the SED fitting process can be instrumental in the optimal
exploitation of the wealth of data that current (eROSITA) and future (ATHENA)

          <p>Even though there have been the various varying speed of light (VSL)
cosmology models, they remain out of the mainstream because of their possible
violation of physics laws built into fundamental physics. In order to be the
VSL as a viable theory, it should inherit the success of special relativity
including Maxwell equations and thermodynamics at least. Thus, we adopt that
the speed of light, $\tilde c$ varies for the cosmic time not for the local
time, {\it i.e.}, $\tilde c[z]$ where $z$ is the cosmological redshift. When
one describes the background FLRW universe, one can define the constant-time
hypersurface by using physical quantities such as temperature, density, and
$\tilde c$. It is because they evolve in time, and the homogeneity of the
Universe demands that they must equal at the equal cosmic time. The variation
of $\tilde c$ accompanies the joint variations of all related physical
constants in order to satisfy the Lorentz invariance, thermodynamics, and
Bianchi identity. We call this VSL model as a "minimally extended VSL (meVSL)".
We derive cosmological observables of meVSL and obtain the constraints on the
variation of $\tilde c$ by using the current observations. Interestingly, $z$
and all geometrical distances except the luminosity distance of meVSL are the
same as those of general relativity. However, the Hubble parameter of meVSL is
rescaled as $H = (1+z)^{-b/4} H^{(\rm GR)}$ which might be used as a solution
for the tension of the Hubble parameter measurements. In this manuscript, we
provide the main effects of meVSL on various cosmological observations
including BBN, CMB, SZE, BAO, SNe, GWs, H, SL, and $\Delta \alpha$.

the regime of strong washout. The key idea behind wash-in leptogenesis is to
generalize standard freeze-out leptogenesis to a nonminimal cosmological
background in which the chemical potentials of all particles not in chemical
equilibrium at the temperature of leptogenesis are allowed to take arbitrary
values. This sets the stage for building a plethora of new baryogenesis models
where chemical potentials generated at high temperatures are reprocessed to
generate a nonvanishing B-L asymmetry at low temperatures. As concrete
examples, we discuss wash-in leptogenesis after axion inflation and in the

          <p>We study the cosmic variance limit on constraining primordial non-Gaussianity
for a variety of theory-motivated shapes. We consider general arguments for 2D
and 3D surveys, with a particular emphasis on the CMB. A scale-invariant
$N$-point correlator can be measured with a signal-to-noise that naively scales
with the square root of the number of observed modes. This intuition generally
fails for two reasons. First, the signal-to-noise scaling is reduced due to the
blurring of the last scattering surface at short distances. This blurring is
caused by the combination of projection and damping, but the loss of signal is
not due to exponential decay, as both signal and noise are equally damped.
Second, the behavior of the $N$-point correlator in the squeezed and collapsed
(for $N&gt;3$) limits can enhance the scaling of the signal-to-noise with the
resolution, even with a reduced range of momenta probing these limits. We
provide analytic estimates for all $N$-point correlators. We show that blurring
affects equilateral-like shapes much more than squeezed ones. We discuss under
what conditions the optimistic scalings in the collapsed limit can be
exploited. Lastly, we confirm our analytical estimates with numerical
calculations of the signal-to-noise for local, orthogonal and equilateral
bispectra, and local trispectra. We also show that adding polarization to
intensity data enhances the scaling for equilateral-like spectra.

          <p>In this paper, we interpret the dark energy phenomenon as an averaged effect
caused by small scale inhomogeneities of the universe with the use of the
spatial averaged approach of Buchert. Two models are considered here, one of
which assumes that the backreaction term ${\cal Q}_\CD$ and the averaged
spatial Ricci scalar $\average{\CR}$ obey the scaling laws of the volume scale
factor $a_\CD$ at adequately late times, and the other one adopts the ansatz
that the backreaction term ${\cal Q}_\CD$ is a constant in the recent universe.
Thanks to the effective geometry introduced by Larena et. al. in their previous
work, we confront these two backreaction models with latest type Ia supernova
and Hubble parameter observations, coming out with the results that the
constant backreaction model is slightly favoured over the other model, and
within $1\sigma$ confidence interval of the parameter $n$ in the scaling
backreaction model, $\mid{\cal Q}_\CD\mid$ decreases with the increase of the
volume scale factor $a_\CD$ at adequately late times. Also, the numerical
simulation results show that the constant backreaction model predicts a smaller
expansion rate and decelerated expansion rate than the other model does at
redshifts higher than about 1, and both backreaction terms begin to accelerate
the universe at a redshift around 0.6. In addition, by confronting the standard
cosmological model against the same datasets, we find that the effective
geometry tends to push the constraint toward a smaller cosmological constant
term.

          <p>The discovery of $19$ dwarf galaxies without dark matter provides,
counter-intuitively, strong support for the $\Lambda$CDM standard model of
cosmology. Their presence is well accommodated in a scenario where the dark
matter is in the form of cold dark particles. However, it is interesting to
explore quantitatively what is needed from modified gravity models to
accommodate the presence of these galaxies and what extra degree of freedom is
needed in these models. To this end, we derive the dynamics at galaxy scales
(Virial theorem) for a general class of modified gravity models. We distinguish
between theories that satisfy the Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem, and those that
don't. Our aim is to develop tests that can distinguish whether dark matter is
part of the theory of gravity or a particle. The 19 dwarf galaxies discovered
provide us with a stringent test for models of modified gravity. Our main
finding is that there will always be an extra contribution to the Virial
theorem coming from the modification of gravity, even if a certain galaxy shows
very small, if not negligible, trace of dark matter, as has been reported
recently. Thus, if these and more galaxies are confirmed as devoid (or
negligible) of dark matter, while other similar galaxies have abundant dark
matter, it seems interesting to find modifications of gravity to describe dark
matter. Our result can be used by future astronomical surveys to put
constraints on the parameters of modified gravity models at astrophysical
scales where dark matter is described as such.

          <p>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been recently applied as a novel
emulation technique for large scale structure simulations. Recent results show
that GANs can be used as a fast, efficient and computationally cheap emulator
for producing novel weak lensing convergence maps as well as cosmic web data in
2-D and 3-D. However, like any algorithm, the GAN approach comes with a set of
limitations, such as an unstable training procedure and the inherent randomness
of the produced outputs. In this work we employ a number of techniques commonly
used in the machine learning literature to address the mentioned limitations.
In particular, we train a GAN to produce both weak lensing convergence maps and
dark matter overdensity field data for multiple redshifts, cosmological
parameters and modified gravity models. In addition, we train a GAN using the
newest Illustris data to emulate dark matter, gas and internal energy
distribution data simultaneously. Finally, we apply the technique of latent
space interpolation to control which outputs the algorithm produces. Our
results indicate a 1-20% difference between the power spectra of the
GAN-produced and the training data samples depending on the dataset used and
whether Gaussian smoothing was applied. Finally, recent research on generative
models suggests that such algorithms can be treated as mappings from a
lower-dimensional input (latent) space to a higher dimensional (data) manifold.
We explore such a theoretical description as a tool for better understanding
the latent space interpolation procedure.

          <p>Topological defects form at cosmological phase transitions by the Kibble
mechanism. Cosmic strings and superstrings can lead to particularly interesting
astrophysical and cosmological consequences, but this study is is currently
limited by the availability of accurate numerical simulations, which in turn is
bottlenecked by hardware resources and computation time. Aiming to eliminate
this bottleneck, in recent work we introduced and validated a GPU-accelerated
evolution code for local Abelian-Higgs strings networks. While this leads to
significant gains in speed, it is still limited by the physical memory
available on a graphical accelerator. Here we report on a further step towards
our main goal, by implementing and validating a multiple GPU extension of the
earlier code, and further demonstrate its good scalability, both in terms of
strong and weak scaling. A $8192^3$ production run, using $4096$ GPUs, runs in
$33.2$ minutes of wall clock time on the Piz Daint supercomputer.

          <p>We develop a general approach to distill symbolic representations of a
learned deep model by introducing strong inductive biases. We focus on Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). The technique works as follows: we first encourage
sparse latent representations when we train a GNN in a supervised setting, then
we apply symbolic regression to components of the learned model to extract
explicit physical relations. We find the correct known equations, including
force laws and Hamiltonians, can be extracted from the neural network. We then
apply our method to a non-trivial cosmology example-a detailed dark matter
simulation-and discover a new analytic formula which can predict the
concentration of dark matter from the mass distribution of nearby cosmic
structures. The symbolic expressions extracted from the GNN using our technique
also generalized to out-of-distribution data better than the GNN itself. Our
approach offers alternative directions for interpreting neural networks and
discovering novel physical principles from the representations they learn.

          <p>Cosmic voids provide a powerful probe of the origin and evolution of
structures in the Universe because their dynamics can remain near-linear to the
present day. As a result they have the potential to connect large scale
structure at late times to early-Universe physics. Existing "watershed"-based
algorithms, however, define voids in terms of their morphological properties at
low redshift. The degree to which the resulting regions exhibit linear dynamics
is consequently uncertain, and there is no direct connection to their evolution
from the initial density field. A recent void definition addresses these issues
by considering "anti-halos". This approach consists of inverting the initial
conditions of an $N$-body simulation to swap overdensities and underdensities.
After evolving the pair of initial conditions, anti-halos are defined by the
particles within the inverted simulation that are inside halos in the original
(uninverted) simulation. In this work, we quantify the degree of non-linearity
of both anti-halos and watershed voids using the Zel'dovich approximation. We
find that non-linearities are introduced by voids with radii less than
$5\,\mathrm{Mpc}\,h^{-1}$, and that both anti-halos and watershed voids can be
made into highly linear sets by removing these voids.

          <p>The XENON1T collaboration recently reported the excess of events from recoil
electrons, possibly giving an insight into new area beyond the Standard Model
(SM) of particle physics. We try to explain this excess by considering
effective interactions between the sterile neutrinos and the SM particles. In
this paper, we present an effective model based on one-particle-irreducible
interaction vertices at low energies that are induced from the SM gauge
symmetric four-fermion operators at high energies. The effective interaction
strength is constrained by the SM precision measurements, astrophysical and
cosmological observations. We introduce a novel effective electromagnetic
interaction between sterile neutrinos and SM neutrinos, which can successfully
explain the XENON1T event rate through inelastic scattering of the sterile
neutrino dark matter from Xenon electrons. We find that sterile neutrinos with
masses around $90$ keV and specific effective coupling can fit well with the
XENON1T data where the best fit points preserving DM constraints and possibly
describe the anomalies in other experiments.

inflationary potentials that include the monomial power-law chaotic type of
potentials, namely, for the quadratic, quartic and sextic potentials and also
for a Higgs-like symmetry breaking potential, considering different values for
the vacuum expectation value in the latter case. We obtain the probability
density function for the number of inflationary e-folds and for other relevant
quantities for each model and produce probabilistic results drawn from these
distributions. This study allows us to discuss under which conditions each
model could eventually lead to observable signatures on the spectrum of the
cosmic microwave background, or, else, be also excluded for not predicting a
suffcient amount of accelerated expansion. The effect of radiation on the
predictions for each model is explicitly quantified. The obtained results
indicate that the number of inflationary e-folds in loop quantum cosmology is
not a priori an arbitrary number, but can in principle be a predictable
quantity, even though the results are dependent on the model and on the amount
of radiation in the Universe prior to the start of the inflationary regime.

          <p>We present a search for axion-like polarization oscillations in the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) with observations from the Keck Array. A local axion
field induces an all-sky, temporally sinusoidal rotation of CMB polarization. A
CMB polarimeter can thus function as a direct-detection experiment for
axion-like dark matter. We develop techniques to extract an oscillation signal.
Many elements of the method are generic to CMB polarimetry experiments and can
be adapted for other datasets. As a first demonstration, we process data from
the 2012 observing season to set upper limits on the axion-photon coupling
constant in the mass range $10^{-21}$-$10^{-18}~\mathrm{eV}$, which corresponds
to oscillation periods on the order of hours to months. We find no
statistically significant deviations from the background model. For periods
larger than $24~\mathrm{hr}$ (mass $m &lt; 4.8 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$), the
median 95%-confidence upper limit is equivalent to a rotation amplitude of
$0.68^\circ$, which constrains the axion-photon coupling constant to
$g_{\phi\gamma} &lt; \left ( 1.1 \times 10^{-11}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1} \right )
m/\left (10^{-21}~\mathrm{eV} \right )$, if axion-like particles constitute all
of the dark matter. The constraints can be improved substantially with data
already collected by the BICEP series of experiments. Current and future CMB
polarimetry experiments are expected to achieve sufficient sensitivity to rule
out unexplored regions of the axion parameter space.

the observed discrepancies between early- and late-time probes of the universe.
This class of models, dubbed DDM, characterizes the evolution of comoving dark
matter density with two extra parameters. We investigate how DDM affects key
cosmological observables such as the CMB temperature and matter power spectra.
Combining 3x2pt data from Year 1 of the Dark Energy Survey,Planck-2018 CMB
temperature and polarization data, Supernova (SN) Type Ia data from Pantheon,
and BAO data from BOSS DR12, MGS and 6dFGS, we place new constraints on the
amount of dark matter that has decayed and the rate with which it converts to
dark radiation. The fraction of the decayed dark matter in units of the current
amount of dark matter, $\zeta$, is constrained at 68% confidence level to be
&lt;0.32 for DES-Y1 3x2pt data, &lt;0.030 for CMB+SN+BAO data, and &lt;0.037 for the
combined dataset. The probability that the DES and CMB+SN+BAO datasets are
concordant increases from 4% for the $\Lambda$CDM model to 8% (less tension)
for DDM. Moreover, tension in $S_8=\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$ between DES-Y1
3x2pt and CMB+SN+BAO is reduced from 2.3$\sigma$ to 1.9$\sigma$. We find no
reduction in the Hubble tension when the combined data is compared to
distance-ladder measurements in the DDM model. The maximum-posterior
goodness-of-fit statistics of DDM and $\Lambda$CDM are comparable, indicating
no preference for the DDM cosmology over $\Lambda$CDM.

correlation of dark matter halo properties with the large-scale environment. We
consider halo populations split into four Cosmic Web (CW) elements: voids,
walls, filaments, and nodes. For the first time we present a study of CW
effects for halos covering six decades in mass: $10^{8}-10^{14}{h^{-1}{\rm
M}_{\odot}}$. We find that the fraction of halos living in various web
components is a strong function of mass, with the majority of
$M&gt;10^{12}{h^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}}$ halos living in filaments and nodes. Low
mass halos are more equitably distributed in filaments, walls, and voids. For
halo density profiles and formation times we find a universal mass threshold of
$M_{th}\sim6\times10^{10}{h^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}}$ below which these properties
vary with environment. Here, filament halos have the steepest
concentration-mass relation, walls are close to the overall mean, and void
halos have the flattest relation. This amounts to $c_{200}$ for filament and
void halos that are respectively $14\%$ higher and $7\%$ lower than the mean at
$M=2\times10^8{h^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}}$, with low-mass node halos being most
likely splashed-back. We find double power-law fits that very well describe
$c(M)$ for the four environments in the whole probed mass range. A
complementary picture is found for the average formation times, with the
mass-formation time relations following trends shown for the concentrations:
the nodes halos being the oldest and void halo the youngest. The CW
environmental effect is much weaker when studying the halo spin and shapes. The
trends with halo mass is reversed: the small halos with $M&lt;10^{10}{h^{-1}{\rm

visible for more massive void and walls halos, which, on average, are
characterized by lower spin and higher triaxiality parameters.
