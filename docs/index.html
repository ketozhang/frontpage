          <p>High-dimensional probability density estimation for inference suffers from
the "curse of dimensionality". For many physical inference problems, the full
posterior distribution is unwieldy and seldom used in practice. Instead, we
propose direct estimation of lower-dimensional marginal distributions,
bypassing high-dimensional density estimation or high-dimensional Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. By evaluating the two-dimensional marginal
posteriors we can unveil the full-dimensional parameter covariance structure.
We additionally propose constructing a simple hierarchy of fast neural
regression models, called Moment Networks, that compute increasing moments of
any desired lower-dimensional marginal posterior density; these reproduce exact
results from analytic posteriors and those obtained from Masked Autoregressive
Flows. We demonstrate marginal posterior density estimation using
high-dimensional LIGO-like gravitational wave time series and describe
applications for problems of fundamental cosmology.

          <p>Many different studies have shown that a wealth of cosmological information
resides on small, non-linear scales. Unfortunately, there are two challenges to
overcome to utilize that information. First, we do not know the optimal
estimator that will allow us to retrieve the maximum information. Second,
baryonic effects impact that regime significantly and in a poorly understood
manner. Ideally, we would like to use an estimator that extracts the maximum
cosmological information while marginalizing over baryonic effects. In this
work we show that neural networks can achieve that. We made use of data where
the maximum amount of cosmological information is known: power spectra and 2D
Gaussian density fields. We also contaminate the data with simplified baryonic
effects and train neural networks to predict the value of the cosmological
parameters. For this data, we show that neural networks can 1) extract the
maximum available cosmological information, 2) marginalize over baryonic
effects, and 3) extract cosmological information that is buried in the regime
dominated by baryonic physics. We also show that neural networks learn the
priors of the data they are trained on. We conclude that a promising strategy
to maximize the scientific return of cosmological experiments is to train
neural networks on state-of-the-art numerical simulations with different
strengths and implementations of baryonic effects.

          <p>Axion couplings to photons could induce photon-axion conversion in the
presence of magnetic fields in the Universe. The conversion could impact
various cosmic distance measurements such as luminosity distances to type Ia
supernovae and angular distances to galaxy clusters in different ways. We
consider different combinations of the most updated distance measurements to
constrain the axion-photon coupling. Depending on the models of magnetic field
in the intracluster medium, we find the upper bounds on axion-photon couplings
to be around $5 \times (10^{-13} - 10^{-12})$ (nG/$B$) GeV$^{-1}$ for axion
mass below $5 \times 10^{-13}$ eV, where $B$ is the strength of the magnetic

Hubble rate as a function of redshift reconstructable from various distance
measurements, and insensitive to today's Hubble rate, of which there is a
tension between early and late cosmological measurements. As an appendix, we
discuss model building challenges to use photon-axion conversion to make type

          <p>Time-delay cosmography with gravitationally lensed quasars plays an important
role in anchoring the absolute distance scale and hence measuring the Hubble
constant, $H_{0}$, independent of traditional distance ladder methodology. A
current potential limitation of time delay distance measurements is the
"mass-sheet transformation" (MST) which leaves the lensed imaging unchanged but
changes the distance measurements and the derived value of $H_0$. In this work
we show that the standard method of addressing the MST in time delay
cosmography, through a combination of high-resolution imaging and the
measurement of the stellar velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy, depends
on the assumption that the ratio, $D_{\rm s}/D_{\rm ds}$, of angular diameter
distances to the background quasar and between the lensing galaxy and the
quasar can be constrained. This is typically achieved through the assumption of
a particular cosmological model. Previous work (TDCOSMO IV) addressed the
mass-sheet degeneracy and derived $H_{0}$ under the assumption of $\Lambda$CDM
model. In this paper we show that the mass sheet degeneracy can be broken
without relying on a specific cosmological model by combining lensing with
relative distance indicators such as supernovae type Ia and baryon acoustic
oscillations, which constrain the shape of the expansion history and hence
$D_{\rm s}/D_{\rm ds}$. With this approach, we demonstrate that the mass-sheet
degeneracy can be constrained in a cosmological-model-independent way, and
hence model-independent distance measurements in time-delay cosmography under
mass-sheet transformations can be obtained.

          <p>We present a Gibbs sampling solution to the map-making problem for CMB
measurements, building on existing destriping methodology. Gibbs sampling
breaks the computationally heavy destriping problem into two separate steps;
noise filtering and map binning. Considered as two separate steps, both are
computationally much cheaper than solving the combined problem. This provides a
huge performance benefit as compared to traditional methods, and allows us for
the first time to bring the destriping baseline length to a single sample. We
apply the Gibbs procedure to simulated Planck 30 GHz data. We find that gaps in
the time-ordered data are handled efficiently by filling them with simulated
noise as part of the Gibbs process. The Gibbs procedure yields a chain of map
samples, from which we may compute the posterior mean as a best-estimate map.
The variation in the chain provides information on the correlated residual
noise, without need to construct a full noise covariance matrix. However, if
only a single maximum-likelihood frequency map estimate is required, we find
that traditional conjugate gradient solvers converge much faster than a Gibbs
sampler in terms of total number of iterations. The conceptual advantages of
the Gibbs sampling approach lies in statistically well-defined error
propagation and systematic error correction, and this methodology forms the
conceptual basis for the map-making algorithm employed in the BeyondPlanck
framework, which implements the first end-to-end Bayesian analysis pipeline for
CMB observations.

into dark-sector leptons without violating lepton number. To transfer this
lepton asymmetry to the baryon asymmetry, the dark leptons scatter on
additional dark-sector states charged under lepton and baryon number.
Amusingly, this transfer proceeds without electroweak sphalerons, which are no
longer active at such low scales. We present two example models which can
achieve this transfer while remaining consistent with current limits. The

spectra: the use of single-epoch matter power spectra in integrals over
redshift. We disentangle this from the closely connected Limber's
approximation. We derive the unequal-time matter power spectrum at one-loop in
standard perturbation theory and effective field theory to deal with non-linear
physics. We compare these formalisms and conclude that the unequal-time power
spectrum using effective field theory breaks for scales $k \sim 0.4 h/ Mpc$. As
an alternative, we introduce the midpoint approximation. We also provide, for
the first time, a fitting function for the time evolution of the effective
field theory counterterms based on the Quijote simulations. Then we compute the
angular power spectrum using a range of approaches: the Limber's approximation,
and the geometric and midpoint approximations. We compare our results with the
exact calculation at all angular scales using the unequal-time power spectrum.
We use DES Y1 and LSST-like redshift distributions for our analysis. We find
that the use of the Limber's approximation in weak lensing diverges from the
exact calculation of the angular power spectrum on large-angle separations,
$\ell &lt; 10$. Even though this deviation is of order $2\%$ maximum for cosmic
lensing, we find the biggest effect for galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy
lensing. We show that not only is this true for upcoming galaxy surveys, but
also for current data such as DES Y1. Finally, we make our pipeline and

          <p>Density perturbations related to structure formations are expected to be
different in dissipative and non-dissipative universes, even if the background
evolution of the two universes is the same. To clarify the difference between
the two universes, first-order density perturbations are studied, using two
types of holographic cosmological models. The first type is a "$\Lambda(t)$
model" similar to a time-varying $\Lambda(t)$ cosmology for the non-dissipative
universe. The second type is a "BV model" similar to a bulk viscous cosmology
for the dissipative universe. To systematically examine the two different
universes, a power-law term proportional to $H^{\alpha}$ is applied to the
$\Lambda(t)$ and BV (bulk-viscous-cosmology-like) models, assuming a flat
Friedmann--Robertson--Walker model for the late universe. Here, $H$ is the
Hubble parameter and $\alpha$ is a free parameter whose value is a real number.
The $\Lambda(t)$-$H^{\alpha}$ and BV-$H^{\alpha}$ models are used to examine
first-order density perturbations for matter, in which the background evolution
of the two models is equivalent. In addition, thermodynamic constraints on the
two models are discussed, with a focus on the maximization of entropy on the
horizon of the universe, extending previous analyses [Phys. Rev. D 100, 123545

the $\Lambda(t)$-$H^{\alpha}$ model for small $|\alpha|$ values is found to be
consistent with observations and satisfies the thermodynamic constraints,
compared with the BV-$H^{\alpha}$ model. The results show that the
non-dissipative universe described by the $\Lambda(t)$-$H^{\alpha}$ model

          <p>Since its launch in 1999, the XMM-\textit{Newton} mission has compiled the
largest catalogue of serendipitous X-ray sources, with the 3XMM being the third
version of this catalogue. This is because of the combination of a large
effective area (5000 $\rm cm^2$ at 1 keV) and a wide field of view (30 arcmin).
The 3XMM-DR6 catalogue contains about 470,000 unique X-ray sources over an area
of 982 $\rm deg^2$. A significant fraction of these (100,178 sources) have
reliable optical, near/mid-IR counterparts in the SDSS, PANSTARRS, VIDEO,
UKIDSS and WISE surveys. In a previous paper we have presented photometric
redshifts for these sources using the TPZ machine learning algorithm. About one
fourth of these (22,677) have adequate photon statistics so that a reliable
X-ray spectrum can be extracted. Obviously, owing to both the X-ray counts
selection and the optical counterpart constraint, the sample above is biased
towards the bright sources. Here, we present XMMFITCAT-Z: a spectral fit
catalogue for these sources using the Bayesian X-ray Analysis (BXA) technique.
As a science demonstration of the potential of the present catalogue, we
comment on the optical and mid-IR colours of the 765 X-ray absorbed sources
with $N_\mathrm{H} &gt; 10^{22}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. We show that a considerable
fraction of X-ray selected AGN would not be classified as AGN following the
mid-IR W1-W2 vs. W2 selection criterion. These are AGN with lower luminosities,
where the contribution of the host galaxy to the MIR emission is
non-negligible. Only one third of obscured AGN in X-rays present red colours or
r-W2 &gt; 6. Then it appears that the r-W2 criterion, often used in the literature
for the selection of obscured AGN, produces very different X-ray absorbed AGN
samples compared to the standard X-ray selection criteria.

datasets we considered include a Chandra sample of 12 clusters and the X-COP
sample of 12 clusters. We find that for both these samples, either the
intrinsic scatter is large (X-COP sample) or a definitive conclusion cannot be
drawn because of large errors in the fits (Chandra sample). Therefore, we do
not find any evidence from our analysis for the radial acceleration relation
with a tight intrinsic scatter for these cluster samples. For both the catalogs
however, the acceleration scale we obtain is about an order of magnitude larger
than that obtained for galaxies, and is agreement with both the recent
estimates.

          <p>Recent cosmic shear studies have reported discrepancies of up to $1\sigma$ on
the parameter ${S_{8}=\sigma_{8}\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}}$ between the
analysis of shear power spectra and two-point correlation functions, derived
from the same shear catalogs. It is not a priori clear whether the measured
discrepancies are consistent with statistical fluctuations. In this paper, we
investigate this issue in the context of the forthcoming analyses from the
third year data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES-Y3). We analyze DES-Y3 mock
catalogs from Gaussian simulations with a fast and accurate importance sampling
pipeline. We show that the methodology for determining matching scale cuts in
harmonic and real space is the key factor that contributes to the scatter
between constraints derived from the two statistics. We compare the published
scales cuts of the KiDS, Subaru-HSC and DES surveys, and find that the
correlation coefficients of posterior means range from over 80% for our
proposed cuts, down to 10% for cuts used in the literature. We then study the
interaction between scale cuts and systematic uncertainties arising from
multiple sources: non-linear power spectrum, baryonic feedback, intrinsic
alignments, uncertainties in the point-spread function, and redshift
distributions. We find that, given DES-Y3 characteristics and proposed cuts,
these uncertainties affect the two statistics similarly; the differential
biases are below a third of the statistical uncertainty, with the largest
biases arising from intrinsic alignment and baryonic feedback. While this work
is aimed at DES-Y3, the tools developed can be applied to Stage-IV surveys
where statistical errors will be much smaller.

          <p>Ultraviolet (UV) emission from galaxies is associated with hot components,
whether from stellar sources or not. By making use of colour-colour diagrams,
early-type galaxies (ETGs) can be classified in terms of their UV emission in
mainly three categories: residual star-formation, UV weak, and UV upturn. This
thesis aims at investigating galaxies presenting UV upturn by comparing them to
UV weak systems. This investigation has three fronts: (i) the assessment of the
evolution in redshift (z) and stellar mass (logM*) of the fraction of UV upturn
systems in terms of the total of UV bright ETGs; (ii) the stratification of the
first study in terms of emission lines; (iii) the comparison between UV weak

the first front, a Bayesian logistic model was applied. The second front
expands on the first, dividing the sample into emission line classes. The final
front is focused on the study of stellar population properties of UV weak and
upturn systems, by making use of catalogues from GAMA-DR3. The results show
that the fraction of UV upturn systems rises up to z~0.25, followed by a
decline which remains to be confirmed. By stratifying the sample into emission
line classes, the galaxies classified as retired/passive -- the ones associated
with evolved stellar phases -- dominate the behaviour with z and logM*. By
analysing the stellar populations of both types of systems, different
characteristics emerge such as median ages, metallicities, and time since last
burst of star formation. These results seem to indicate that UV upturn systems
have narrower star-formation histories, higher metallicities, and slightly
older populations.

          <p>A measurement of the sum of neutrino masses is one of the main applications
of upcoming measurements of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). This measurement can be confounded by modelling uncertainties
related to so-called "baryonic effects" on the clustering of matter, arising
from gas dynamics, star formation, and feedback from active galactic nuclei and
supernovae. In particular, a wrong assumption about the form of baryonic
effects on CMB lensing can bias a neutrino mass measurement by a significant
fraction of the statistical uncertainty. In this paper, we investigate three
methods for mitigating this bias: (1) restricting the use of small-scale CMB
lensing information when constraining neutrino mass; (2) using an external
tracer to remove the low-redshift contribution to a CMB lensing map; and (3)
marginalizing over a parametric model for baryonic effects on large-scale
structure. We test these methods using Fisher matrix forecasts for experiments
resembling the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, using a variety of recent
hydrodynamical simulations to represent the range of possible baryonic effects,
and using cosmic shear measured by the Rubin Observatory's LSST as the tracer
in method (2). We find that a combination of (1) and (2), or (3) on its own,
will be effective in reducing the bias induced by baryonic effects on a
neutrino mass measurement to a negligible level, without a significant increase
in the associated statistical uncertainty.

          <p>The well-developed separate universe technique enables accurate calibration
of the response of any observable to an isotropic long-wavelength density
fluctuation. The large-scale environment also hosts tidal modes that perturb
all observables anisotropically. As in the separate universe, both the long
tidal and density modes can be absorbed by an effective anisotropic background,
on which the interaction and evolution of the short modes change accordingly.
We further develop the tidal simulation method, including proper corrections to
the second order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT) to generate initial
conditions of the simulations. We measure the linear tidal responses of the
matter power spectrum, at high redshift from our modified 2LPT, and at low
redshift from the tidal simulations. Our results agree qualitatively with
previous works, but exhibit quantitative differences in both cases. We also
measure the linear tidal response of the halo shapes, or the shape bias, and
find its universal relation with the linear halo bias, for which we provide a
fitting formula. Furthermore, analogous to the assembly bias, we study the
secondary dependence of the shape bias, and discover for the first time
dependence on halo concentration and axis ratio. Our results provide useful
insights for studies of the intrinsic alignment as source of either
contamination or information. These effects need to be correctly taken into
account when one uses intrinsic alignments of galaxy shapes as a precision
cosmological tool.

the effect of tracer density, grid resolution, gravity model, bias model and
likelihood on the inferred initial conditions. We find that the
cross-correlation coefficient between true and inferred phases reacts weakly to

derived from a Gaussian model on a broad range of scales. The bias in the
amplitude of the inferred initial conditions, on the other hand, depends
strongly on the bias model and the likelihood. We conclude that the bias model

theory of dark baryons charged under a non-Abelian gauge group, i.e., a dark
Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD). For sub-eV dark baryon masses, the inner region
of dark matter halos is naturally at 'nuclear density', allowing for the
formation of exotic states of matter, akin to neutron stars. The Tremaine-Gunn
lower bound on the mass of fermionic dark matter, i.e., the dark baryons, is

the astrophysics of these STrongly-interacting Ultra-light Millicharged

Yet, at $ z_{\text{drag}} \simeq 1060$, $D_{M, \text{fid}}(1060)/r_{d,

assumption of a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. At the relatively low redshifts at
which isotropic BAO studies were performed, the divergence is smaller than
study uncertainties. However, while the transverse measure, $\alpha_{\perp}$
provides a reliable value in real space, not corrupted by redshift distortion,
the isotropic measure, $\alpha$, has a radial component, and is influenced by
redshift distortion. That distortion recommends against the inclusion of
isotropic studies in cosmological parameter evaluations. At the high redshifts
of Ly$\alpha$ forest BAO studies, $z\sim$ 2.35, the deviations of the
anisotropic BAO algorithms from the flat $\Lambda$CDM solutions give rise to
markedly deceptive results. We replicate an example, in which those algorithms
lead to a value of $\Omega_{m}$ which is more than 15 per cent lower than that

          <p>We point out that a model with scalar fields with a large nonminimal coupling
to the Ricci scalar, such as Higgs inflation, can be regarded as a nonlinear
sigma model (NLSM). With the inclusion of not only the scalar fields but also
the conformal mode of the metric, our definition of the target space of the
NLSM is invariant under the frame transformation. We show that the
$\sigma$-meson that linearizes this NLSM to be a linear sigma model (LSM)
corresponds to the scalaron, the degree of freedom associated to the $R^2$ term
in the Jordan frame. We demonstrate that quantum corrections inevitably induce
this $\sigma$-meson in the large-$N$ limit, thus providing a frame independent
picture for the emergence of the scalaron. The resultant LSM only involves
renormalizable interactions and hence its perturbative unitarity holds up to
the Planck scale unless it hits a Landau pole, which is in agreement with the
renormalizability of quadratic gravity.

          <p>We investigate three issues that have been discussed in the context of
inflation: Fading of the importance of quantum non-commutativity; the
phenomenon of quantum squeezing; and the ability to approximate the quantum
state by a distribution function on the classical phase space. In the standard
treatments, these features arise from properties of mode functions of quantum
fields in (near) de Sitter space-time. Therefore, the three notions are often
assumed to be essentially equivalent, representing different facets of the same
phenomenon. We analyze them in general Friedmann-Lemaitre- Robertson-Walker
space-times, through the lens of geometric structures on the classical phase
space. The analysis shows that: (i) inflation does not play an essential role;
classical behavior can emerge much more generally; (ii) the three notions are
conceptually distinct; classicality can emerge in one sense but not in another;
and, (iii) the third notion is realized in a surprisingly strong sense; there
is exact equality between completely general $n$-point functions in the
classical theory and those in the quantum theory, provided the quantum
operators are Weyl ordered. These features arise already for linear
cosmological perturbations by themselves: considerations such as mode-mode
coupling, decoherence, and measurement theory --although important in their own
right-- are not needed for emergence of classical behavior in any of the three
senses discussed. Generality of the results stems from the fact that they can
be traced back to geometrical structures on the classical phase space,
available in a wide class of systems. Therefore, this approach may also be
useful in other contexts.

unexplored. However, a renaissance in low-frequency polarimetry has been
enabled by pathfinder and precursor instruments for the Square Kilometre Array.
In this second paper from the POlarised GaLactic and Extragalactic All-Sky
Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Survey -- the POlarised GLEAM Survey, or POGS
-- we present the results from our all-sky MWA Phase I Faraday Rotation Measure
survey. Our survey covers nearly the entire Southern sky in the Declination
range $-82^{\circ}$ to $+30^{\circ}$ at a resolution between around three and
seven arcminutes (depending on Declination) using data in the frequency range
169$-$231 MHz. We have performed two targeted searches: the first covering
25,489 square degrees of sky, searching for extragalactic polarised sources;
the second covering the entire sky South of Declination $+30^{\circ}$,
searching for known pulsars. We detect a total of 517 sources with 200 MHz
linearly-polarised flux densities between 9.9 mJy and 1.7 Jy, of which 33 are
known radio pulsars. All sources in our catalogues have Faraday rotation
measures in the range $-328.07$ rad m$^{-2}$ to $+279.62$ rad m$^{-2}$. The
Faraday rotation measures are broadly consistent with results from
higher-frequency surveys, but with typically more than an order of magnitude
improvement in the precision, highlighting the power of low-frequency
polarisation surveys to accurately study Galactic and extragalactic magnetic
fields. We discuss the properties of our extragalactic and known-pulsar source
population, how the sky distribution relates to Galactic features, and identify
a handful of new pulsar candidates among our nominally extragalactic source
population.

          <p>Emergence of $R^2$ inflation which is the best fit framework for CMB
observations till date comes from the attempts to attack the problem of
quantization of gravity which in turn have resulted in the trace anomaly

aiming to construct quantum gravity indicate an inevitability of non-locality
in fundamental physics at small time and length scales. A natural question
would be to employ the $R^2$ inflation as a probe for signatures of
non-locality in the early Universe physics. Recent advances of embedding $R^2$
inflation in a string theory inspired non-local gravity modification provides
very promising theoretical predictions connecting the non-local physics in the

          <p>We propose a new mechanism for the formation of dark matter clumps in the
radiation era. We assume that a light scalar field is decoupled from matter and
oscillates harmonically around its vacuum expectation value. We include
self-interactions and consider the nonrelativistic regime. The scalar dynamics
are described by a fluid approach where the fluid pressure depends on both
quantum and self-interaction effects. When the squared speed of sound of the
scalar fluid becomes negative, an instability arises and the fluctuations of
the scalar energy-density field start growing. They eventually become nonlinear
and clumps form. Subsequently, the clumps aggregate and reach a universal
regime. Afterwards, they play the role of cold dark matter. We apply this
mechanism first to a model with a negative quartic term stabilised by a
positive self-interaction of order six, and then to axion monodromy, where a
subdominant cosine potential corrects a mass term. In the first case, the
squared speed of sound becomes negative when the quartic term dominates,
leading to a tachyonic instability. For axion monodromy, the instability starts
very slowly after the squared speed of sound first becomes negative and then
oscillates around zero. Initially the density perturbations perform acoustic
oscillations due to the quantum pressure. Eventually, they start growing
exponentially due to a parametric resonance.
</p>
<p>In both scenarios, the scalar-field clumps span a wide range of scales and
masses, running from the size of atoms to that of galactic molecular clouds,
and from $10^{-3} \, {\rm gram}$ to thousands of solar masses. Because of
finite-size effects, both from the source and the lens, these dark matter
clumps are far beyond the reach of microlensing observations.

capable of extracting non-Gaussian information from weak lensing (WL) data
sets. Understanding which features in the data determine the output of these

a DNN that has been found in previous work to accurately recover cosmological

constraints on the cosmological parameter pair $(\Omega_m,\sigma_8)$ from a
combination of three commonly used WL statistics (power spectrum, lensing

show that the network can improve the inferred parameter constraints relative

DNN and find that the most relevant pixels are those with extreme $\kappa$

$86-69\%$ of the attribution of the DNN output, defined as the square of the
saliency in input space. In the presence of shape nose, the attribution
concentrates in high convergence regions, with $36-68\%$ of the attribution in

about 1 deg2 of the AEGIS field with 56 narrow-band filters and 4 ugri

extended (galaxies) and point-like (e.g. stars) objects, a necessary step for

is complementary to traditional tools based on explicit modeling. In order to
train and test our classifiers, we crossmatched the miniJPAS dataset with SDSS

crossmatched catalogs. As input for the ML algorithms we use the magnitudes
from the 60 filters together with their errors, with and without the
morphological parameters. We also use the mean PSF in the r detection band for
each pointing. We find that the RF and ERT algorithms perform best in all
scenarios. When analyzing the full magnitude range of 15&lt;r&lt;23.5 we find
AUC=0.957 with RF when using only photometric information, and AUC=0.986 with
ERT when using photometric and morphological information. Regarding feature
importance, when using morphological parameters, FWHM is the most important
feature. When using photometric information only, we observe that broad bands
are not necessarily more important than narrow bands, and errors are as
important as the measurements. ML algorithms can compete with traditional
star/galaxy classifiers, outperforming the latter at fainter magnitudes (r&gt;21).

compact stellar-mass object orbiting a massive black hole, are expected to be
among the primary gravitational wave (GW) sources for the forthcoming LISA
mission. The astrophysical processes leading to the formation of such systems
still remain poorly understood, resulting into large uncertainties in the
predicted cosmic rate of these sources, spanning at least three orders of
magnitude. As LISA can individually resolve mostly EMRIs up to $z\gtrsim1$, the
ensemble of signals below its detection threshold will add up incoherently
forming an unresolved confusion noise, which can be formally described as a
stochastic background. We perform an extensive study of this background by
considering a collection of astrophysically motivated EMRI formation scenarios,
spanning current uncertainties. We find that, for most astrophysical models,
this signal is easily detectable by LISA, with signal to noise ratios of
several hundreds. In fiducial EMRI models -- predicting hundreds of EMRI
detections during mission operations -- the background level is comparable to
the LISA noise, affecting the performance of the instrument around 3 mHz. In
extreme cases, this background can even "erase" the whole LISA sensitivity
bucket in the 2-10 mHz frequency range. This points to the need of a better
understanding of EMRIs' astrophysics for a full assessment of the LISA mission
potential.

nuclei and supernova explosions, that significantly affect the internal regions

physics on cluster statistics is subdominant as compared to other systematics,
the picture is likely to change soon as the amount of high-quality data is
growing fast, urging the community to keep theoretical systematic uncertainties
below the ever-growing statistical precision. In this paper, we study the
effect of baryons on galaxy clusters, and their impact on the cosmological
applications of clusters, using the Magneticum suite of cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations. We show that the impact of baryons on the halo mass
function can be recast in terms on a variation of the mass of the halos
simulated with pure N-body, when baryonic effects are included. The halo mass
function and halo bias are only indirectly affected. Finally, we demonstrate
that neglecting baryonic effects on halos mass function and bias would

which a possible interaction is considered between these two significant

dark matter and dark energy and derive the modified virial theorem for them by
developing a previous approach. It provides an opportunity to study the
evolution of this modified virial theorem with time and interacting constants
for different interacting models. Then we use this obtained virial condition to
investigate the modified mass-temperature relation in galaxy clusters via three
various methods. It reveals that the effect of interaction between dark matter
and dark energy merely appears in the normalization factor of $M\propto
T^{\frac{3}{2}}$. This relation also leads to a new constraint on the constants
of interacting models, which only depends on the concentration parameter and
density profile of the cluster. Then we use five observational data sets to
check some proposed figures for the constants of interaction which have been
resulted from other observational constraints. Finally, by fitting the
observational results to the modified mass-temperature relation, we obtain
values for interacting constants of three models and four specific cases of the
two remained models. In agreement with many other observational outcomes, we
find that according to observational data for masses and temperatures of the

combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing by optimizing the
lens galaxy sample selection using information from Dark Energy Survey (DES)
Year 3 data and assuming the DES Year 1 Metacalibration sample for the sources.
We explore easily reproducible selections based on magnitude cuts in $i$-band

potential gains against those using the well established redMaGiC sample. We
focus on the balance between density and photometric redshift accuracy, while

Our optimal selection, the MagLim sample, satisfies $i &lt; 4 \, z_{\rm phot} +

galaxies than redMaGiC. Assuming a wCDM model and equivalent scale cuts to
mitigate nonlinear effects, this leads to $40\%$ increase in the figure of
merit for the pair combinations of $\Omega_m$, $w$, and $\sigma_8$, and gains
of $16\%$ in $\sigma_8$, $10\%$ in $\Omega_m$, and $12\%$ in $w$. Similarly, in

finding that the optimal selection, $i &lt; 22.2$, has $\sim 7$ times more

slightly worse constraints. We show that our results are robust with respect to
the assumed galaxy bias and photometric redshift uncertainties with only
moderate further gains from increased number of tomographic bins or the
inclusion of bin cross-correlations, except in the case of the flux-limited
