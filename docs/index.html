          <p>Does the value of the Higgs mass parameter affect the expectation value of
local operators in the Standard Model? For essentially all local operators the
answer to this question is "no", and this is one of the avatars of the
hierarchy problem: nothing is "triggered" when the Higgs mass parameter crosses
zero. In this letter, we explore settings in which Higgs mass parameters $can$
act as a "trigger" for some local operators ${\cal O}_T$. In the Standard
Model, this happens for ${\cal O}_T = {\rm Tr} (G \tilde G)$. We also introduce
a "type-0" two Higgs doublet model, with a $Z_4$ symmetry, for which ${\cal
O}_T = H_1 H_2$ is triggered by the Higgs masses, demanding the existence of
new Higgs states necessarily comparable to or lighter than the weak scale, with
no wiggle room to decouple them whatsoever. Surprisingly, this model is not yet
entirely excluded by collider searches, and will be incisively probed by the
high-luminosity run of the LHC, as well as future Higgs factories. We also
discuss a possibility for using this trigger to explain the origin of the weak
scale, invoking a landscape of extremely light, weakly interacting scalars
$\phi_i$, with a coupling to ${\cal O}_T$ needed to make it possible to find
vacua with small enough cosmological constant. The weak scale trigger links the
tuning of the Higgs mass to that of the cosmological constant, while coherent
oscillations of the $\phi_i$ can constitute dark matter.

          <p>Modelling uncertainties at small scales, i.e. high $k$ in the power spectrum
$P(k)$, due to baryonic feedback, nonlinear structure growth and the fact that
galaxies are biased tracers poses a significant obstacle to fully leverage the
constraining power of the Euclid wide-field survey. $k$-cut cosmic shear has
recently been proposed as a method to optimally remove sensitivity to these
scales while preserving usable information. In this paper we generalise the
$k$-cut cosmic shear formalism to $3 \times 2$ point statistics and estimate
the loss of information for different $k$-cuts in a $3 \times 2$ point analysis
of the {\it Euclid} data. Extending the Fisher matrix analysis of Euclid
Collaboration: Blanchard et al. (2019), we assess the degradation in
constraining power for different $k$-cuts. We find that taking a $k$-cut at
$2.6 \ h \ {\rm Mpc} ^{-1}$ yields a dark energy Figure of Merit (FOM) of 1018.
This is comparable to taking a weak lensing cut at $\ell = 5000$ and a galaxy
clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing cut at $\ell = 3000$ in a traditional $3
\times 2$ point analysis. We also find that the fraction of the observed
galaxies used in the photometric clustering part of the analysis is one of the
main drivers of the FOM. Removing $50 \% \ (90 \%)$ of the clustering galaxies
decreases the FOM by $19 \% \ (62 \%)$. Given that the FOM depends so heavily
on the fraction of galaxies used in the clustering analysis, extensive efforts
should be made to handle the real-world systematics present when extending the
analysis beyond the luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample.

          <p>Measurement of fluctuations in diffuse HI 21 cm background radiation from the
post-reionization epoch (z &lt; 6) is a promising avenue to probe the large-scale
structure of the Universe and understand the evolution of galaxies. We observe
the European Large-Area ISO Survey-North 1 (ELAIS-N1) field at 300-500 MHz
using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and employ the
'foreground avoidance' technique to estimate the HI 21 cm power spectrum in the
redshift range z = 1.96-3.58. Given the possible systematics that may remain in
the data, we find the most stringent upper limits on the spherically averaged
21 cm power spectra at k~1.0 Mpc$^{-1}$ are (58.87 mK)$^2$, (61.49 mK)$^2$,
(60.89 mK)$^2$, (105.85 mK)$^2$ at z = 1.96,2.19,2.62 and 3.58, respectively.
We use this to constrain the product of neutral HI mass density (Omega_HI) and
HI bias (b_HI) to the underlying dark matter density field, [Omega_HI*b_HI], as
0.09,0.11,0.12,0.24 at z=1.96,2.19,2.62,3.58, respectively. To the best of our
knowledge these are the first limits on the HI 21 cm power spectra at the
redshift range z = 1.96 - 3.58 and would play a significant role to constrain
the models of galaxy formation and evolution.

          <p>We investigate the gravitational effect of large-scale radiation
perturbations on small-scale structure formation. In addition to making the
growth of matter perturbations scale dependent, the free-streaming of radiation
also affects the coupling between structure formation at small and large
scales. We study this using Separate Universe N-body simulations to compute the
(isotropized) squeezed-limit matter bispectrum and the linear halo bias. Our
results show that the scale dependence in the growth of long-wavelength matter
perturbations, caused by radiation, translates into these quantities acquiring
a non-trivial scale-dependence at $k\lesssim 0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$. In a universe
with radiation composed of cosmic microwave background photons and three
species of massless neutrinos, the bias of halos with $b = 2$ at high $k$ will
decrease by $0.29\%,\ 0.45\%$ and $0.8\%$ between $k = 0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $k
= 0.0005$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at redshifts $z=0,\ 1$, and $3$ respectively. For objects
with $b\gg1$, these differences approach $0.43\%,\ 0.68\%$ and $1.2\%$

          <p>In this work, we use the constrained Gaussian realization technique to study
the early growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations, exploring its relationship with features of the
initial density peaks on large scales, ~1 Mpc/h. Our constrained simulations of
volume (20 Mpc/h)^3 successfully reconstruct the large-scale structure as well
as the black hole growth for the hosts of the rare 10^9 Msun SMBHs found in the
BlueTides simulation at z~7. We run a set of simulations with constrained
initial conditions by imposing a 5 \sigma_0(R_G) peak on scale of R_G = 1 Mpc/h
varying different peak features, such as the shape and compactness as well as
the tidal field surrounding the peak. We find that initial density peaks with
high compactness and low tidal field induce the most rapid BH growth at early
epochs. This is because compact density peaks with a more spherical large scale
matter distribution lead to the formation of high density gas clumps in the
centers of halos, and thus boost early BH accretion. Moreover, such initially
compact density peaks in low tidal field regions also lead to a more compact BH
host galaxy morphology. This can explain the tight correlation between BH
growth and host galaxy compactness seen in observations.

          <p>Light axions can potentially leave a cosmic background, just like neutrinos.
We complete the study of thermal axion production across the electroweak scale
by providing a smooth and continuous treatment through the two phases. Focusing
on both flavor conserving and violating couplings to third generation quarks,
we compute the amount of axions produced via scatterings and decays of thermal
bath particles. We perform a model independent analysis in terms of axion
effective couplings, and we also make predictions for specific microscopic QCD
axion scenarios. This observable effect, parameterized as it is conventional by
an effective number of additional neutrinos, is above the $1\sigma$ sensitivity
of future CMB-S4 surveys. Moreover, if one assumes no large hierarchies among
dimensionless axion couplings to standard model particles, future axion
helioscopes will provide a complementary probe for the parameter region we

          <p>We study the quantum circuit complexity of cosmological perturbations in
different models of the early universe. A natural measure for the complexity of
cosmological perturbations is based on the symplectic group, allowing us to
identify complexity with geodesics in the hyperbolic plane. We investigate the
complexity of both the mode functions and the physical perturbations, arguing
that the latter often provides a more insightful description of the physics
involved. In all models the total complexity reached is rather large.
Inflationary perturbations may be represented by a comparatively simple quantum
circuit, while the perturbations during a matter-dominated contracting phase
present the most rapid growth in complexity. Ekpyrotic perturbations reside in
the middle and are distinguished by the smallest growth of complexity before
horizon exit. Our analysis serves to highlight how different cosmological
models achieve the same end result for the perturbations via different routes
and how all models show a pronounced sensitivity to initial conditions.

21-cm power spectrum from $150 \, {\rm MHz}$ GMRT observations which
corresponds to the neutral hydrogen (HI) at redshift $z = 8.28$. Here TGE is
used to measure the Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum (MAPS)
$C_{\ell}(\Delta\nu)$ first, from which we estimate the 21-cm power spectrum
$P(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel})$. The data here are much too small for a detection,
and the aim is to demonstrate the capabilities of the estimator. We find that
the estimated power spectrum is consistent with the expected foreground and
noise behaviour. This demonstrates that this estimator correctly estimates the
noise bias and subtracts this out to yield an unbiased estimate of the power
spectrum. More than $47\%$ of the frequency channels had to be discarded from
the data owing to radio-frequency interference, however the estimated power
spectrum does not show any artifacts due to missing channels. Finally, we show
that it is possible to suppress the foreground contribution by tapering the sky
response at large angular separations from the phase center. We combine the k
modes within a rectangular region in the `EoR window' to obtain the spherically
binned averaged dimensionless power spectra $\Delta^{2}(k)$ along with the
statistical error $\sigma$ associated with the measured $\Delta^{2}(k)$. The
lowest $k$-bin yields $\Delta^{2}(k)=(61.47)^{2}\,{\rm K}^{2}$ at
$k=1.59\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, with $\sigma=(27.40)^{2} \, {\rm K}^{2}$. We
obtain a $2 \, \sigma$ upper limit of $(72.66)^{2}\,\textrm{K}^{2}$ on the mean

explicitly separates the magnitude of the $k$-modes and their angle to the
line-of-sight direction dependencies. We compute the PS for matter and biased

correct infrared and ultraviolet behavior, free of unwanted divergences. We
also add Effective Field Theory (EFT) counterterms, necessary to account for
small-scale contributions to PT, and employ an IR-resummation prescription to
properly model the smearing of the BAO due to large scale bulk flows within
Standard-PT. To demonstrate the applicability of our formalism, we apply it on
the $\Lambda$CDM and the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ models, and compare our numerical
results against the ELEPHANT suite of $N$-body simulations, finding very good
agreement up to $k= 0.27\, \text{Mpc}^{-1} h$ at $z=0.5$ for the first three
non-vanishing Legendre multipoles of the PS. To our knowledge, the model
presented in this work is the most accurate theoretical EFT-PT for modified
gravity to date, being the only one that accounts for beyond linear local
biasing in redshift-space. Hence, we argue our RSD modeling is a promising tool
to construct theoretical templates in order to test deviations from
$\Lambda$CDM using real data obtained from the next stage of cosmological
surveys such as DESI and LSST.

          <p>We study biasing as a physical phenomenon by analysing power spectra (PS) and
correlation functions (CF) of simulated galaxy samples and dark matter (DM)
samples. We apply an algorithm based on the local densities of particles,
$\rho$, to form populations of simulated galaxies, using particles with $\rho
\ge \rho_0$. We calculate two-point CF of projected (2D) and spatial (3D)
density fields of simulated galaxies for various particle-density limits
$\rho_0$. We compare 3D and 2D CFs; in 2D case we use samples of various
thickness to find the dependence of 2D CFs on thickness of samples. Dominant
elements of the cosmic web are clusters and filaments, separated by voids
filling most of the volume. In individual 2D sheets positions of clusters and
filaments do not coincide. As a result, in projection clusters and filaments
fill in 2D voids. This leads to the decrease of amplitudes of CFs in
projection. For this reason amplitudes of 2D CFs are lower than amplitudes of
3D CFs, the difference is the larger, the thicker are 2D samples. Using PS and
CFs of simulated galaxies and DM we estimate the bias factor for $L^\ast$
galaxies, $b^\ast =1.85 \pm 0.15$.

          <p>We present joint Suzaku and Chandra observations of MKW4. With a global
temperature of 1.6 keV, MKW4 is one of the smallest galaxy groups that have
been mapped in X-rays out to the virial radius. We measure its gas properties
from its center to the virial radius in the north, east, and northeast
directions. Its entropy profile follows a power-law of $\propto r^{1.1}$
between R$_{500}$ and R$_{200}$ in all directions, as expected from the purely
gravitational structure formation model. The well-behaved entropy profiles at
the outskirts of MKW4 disfavor the presence of gas clumping or thermal
non-equilibrium between ions and electrons in this system. We measure an
enclosed baryon fraction of 11% at R$_{200}$, remarkably smaller than the
cosmic baryon fraction of 15%. We note that the enclosed gas fractions at
R$_{200}$ are systematically smaller for groups than for clusters from existing
studies in the literature. The low baryon fraction of galaxy groups, such as
MKW4, suggests that their shallower gravitational potential well may make them
more vulnerable to baryon losses due to AGN feedback or galactic winds. We find
that the azimuthal scatter of various gas properties at the outskirts of MKW4
is significantly lower than in other systems, suggesting that MKW4 is a
spherically symmetric and highly relaxed system.

          <p>Inflationary models including vector fields have attracted a great deal of
attention over the past decade. Such an interest owes to the fact that they
might contribute to, or even be fully responsible for, the curvature
perturbation imprinted in the CMB. However, the necessary breaking of the
vector field's conformal invariance during inflation is not without problems.
In recent years it has been realized that a number of instabilities endangering
the consistency of the theory arise when the conformal invariance is broken by
means of a non-minimal coupling to gravity. In this paper we consider a massive
vector field non-minimally coupled to gravity through the Gauss-Bonnet
invariant, and investigate whether the vector can obtain a nearly
scale-invariant perturbation spectrum while evading the emergence of
perturbative instabilities. We find that the strength of the coupling must be
extremely small if the vector field is to have a chance to contribute to the
total curvature perturbation.

an equation of state and a sound speed, both of them functions of the number of
$e$-folds and four phenomenological parameters. This approach captures a number
of possible inflationary models, including those with non-canonical kinetic
terms or scale-dependent non-gaussianities. We perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo
analyses using the latest cosmological publicly available measurements, which
include Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from the Planck satellite.
Within this parametrization, we discard scale invariance with a significance of
about $10\sigma$, and the running of the spectral index is constrained as
$\alpha_s=-0.60\,^{+0.08}_{-0.10}\times 10^{-3}$ ($68\%$~CL errors). The limit
on the tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r&lt;0.005$ at $95\%$~CL from CMB data alone. We
find no significant evidence for this alternative parameterization with present
cosmological observations. The maximum amplitude of the equilateral
non-gaussianity that we obtain, $|f^{\text{equil}}_{\text{NL}}|&lt; 1$, is much
smaller than the current Planck mission errors, strengthening the case for

spectra of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) seem to indicate that the
naive expectation for the slow-roll hierarchy within the most simple
inflationary paradigm may not be respected in nature. We show that a primordial

observed slow-roll anarchy when fitted to a featureless power spectrum. Future
CMB missions have the key to disentangle among the two possible paradigms and
firmly establish the slow-roll mechanism as the responsible one for the

          <p>We explore an extended cosmological scenario where the dark matter is an
admixture of cold and additional non-cold species. The mass and temperature of
the non-cold dark matter particles are extracted from a number of cosmological
measurements. Among others, we consider tomographic weak lensing data and Milky
Way dwarf satellite galaxy counts. We also study the potential of these
scenarios in alleviating the existing tensions between local measurements and
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) estimates of the $S_8$ parameter, with
$S_8=\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m}$, and of the Hubble constant $H_0$. In principle,
a sub-dominant, non-cold dark matter particle with a mass $m_X\sim$~keV, could
achieve the goals above. However, the preferred ranges for its temperature and
its mass are different when extracted from weak lensing observations and from
Milky Way dwarf satellite galaxy counts, since these two measurements require
suppressions of the matter power spectrum at different scales. Therefore,
solving simultaneously the CMB-weak lensing tensions and the small scale crisis
in the standard cold dark matter picture via only one non-cold dark matter
component seems to be challenging.

with frequency $\sim$1 Hz. This mass scale lies in an open window of
astrophysical constraints, and appears naturally as a consequence of grand
unification (GUT) in string/M-theory. However, with a GUT-scale decay constant
such an ALP overcloses the Universe, and cannot solve the strong CP problem. In
this paper, we present a two axion model in which the 1 Hz ALP constitutes the
entirety of the dark matter (DM) while the QCD axion solves the strong CP
problem but contributes negligibly to the DM relic density. The mechanism to
achieve the correct relic densities relies on low-scale inflation ($m_\phi

such a model. The scale in the axion potential leading to the 1 Hz axion
generates a value for the strong CP phase which oscillates around
$\bar{\theta}_{\rm QCD}\sim 10^{-12}$, within reach of the proton storage ring
electric dipole moment experiment. The 1 Hz axion is also in reach of near

ANN performs excellently on best-fit values and errors of parameters, as well
as correlations between parameters when compared with that of the Markov Chain

of estimating parameters for multiple experiments that have different

resources for parameter inference. Furthermore, we extend the ANN to a
multibranch network to achieve a joint constraint on parameters. We test the
multibranch network using the simulated temperature and polarization power
spectra of the CMB, Type Ia supernovae, and baryon acoustic oscillations, and
almost obtain the same results as the MCMC method. Therefore, we propose that
the ANN can provide an alternative way to accurately and quickly estimate

explanation of a variety of short baseline (SBL) neutrino oscillation
anomalies. However, if one considers neutrino oscillations between active and
sterile neutrinos, such neutrinos would have been fully thermalised in the
early universe, and would be therefore in strong conflict with cosmological
bounds. In this study we first update cosmological bounds on the mass and
energy density of eV-scale sterile neutrinos. We then perform an updated study
of a previously proposed model in which the sterile neutrino couples to a new
light pseudoscalar degree of freedom. Consistently with previous analyses, we
find that the model provides a good fit to all cosmological data and allows the
high value of $H_0$ measured in the local universe to be consistent with
measurements of the cosmic microwave background. However, new high $\ell$
polarisation data constrain the sterile neutrino mass to be less than
approximately 1 eV in this scenario. Finally, we combine the cosmological
bounds on the pseudoscalar model with a Bayesian inference analysis of SBL data
and conclude that only a sterile mass in narrow ranges around 1 eV remains

          <p>We compare the primordial scalar power spectra in the loop cosmological
models using the effective dynamics of the hybrid approach to cosmological
perturbations in which the background is loop quantized but the perturbations
are Fock quantized. The three loop cosmological models under consideration are
the standard LQC, the modified LQC-I (mLQC-I) and the modified LQC-II (mLQC-II)
in the spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe
with a Starobinsky potential. These models arise from different regularizations
of the classical Hamiltonian constraint in the symmetry reduced spacetimes and
aim to capture certain features of quantization in loop quantum gravity. When
applying the techniques in the hybrid approach to mLQC-I/II, we find the
effective Mukhanov-Sasaki equations take the same form as in LQC. The
difference among the three models is encoded in the unique expressions of the
effective masses in each model. We find that the relative difference in the
amplitude of power spectrum between LQC and mLQC-II is approximately $50\%$ in
the infrared and the oscillatory regimes, whereas this difference can be as
large as $100\%$ between mLQC-I and LQC/mLQC-II. Interestingly, in the infrared
and the oscillatory regimes of mLQC-I, we obtain a suppressed power spectrum
from the hybrid approach which is far below the Planck scale. This result is in
a striking contrast to the one obtained from dressed metric approach to
perturbations where the corresponding amplitude in this regime is extremely
large. Our analysis shows that while the phenomenological predictions are in
agreement between two approaches for LQC and mLQC-II, for mLQC-I the
differences between dressed and hybrid approaches can be quite significant. Our
result provides the first robust evidence of difference in predictions between
dressed and hybrid approaches due to respective underlying constructions.

          <p>We present the results of a new, deeper, and complete search for
high-redshift $6.5&lt;z&lt;9.3$ quasars over 977deg$^2$ of the VISTA Kilo-Degree
Infrared Galaxy (VIKING) survey. This exploits a new list-driven dataset
providing photometry in all bands ZYJHKs, for all sources detected by VIKING in
$J$. We use the Bayesian model comparison (BMC) selection method of Mortlock et
al., producing a ranked list of just 21 candidates. The sources ranked 1, 2, 3
and 5 are the four known $z&gt;6.5$ quasars in this field. Additional observations
of the other 17 candidates, primarily DESI Legacy Survey photometry and ESO
FORS2 spectroscopy, confirm that none is a quasar. This is the first complete
sample from the VIKING survey, and we provide the computed selection function.
We include a detailed comparison of the BMC method against two other selection
methods: colour cuts and minimum-$\chi^2$ SED fitting. We find that: i) BMC
produces eight times fewer false positives than colour cuts, while also
reaching 0.3 mag. deeper, ii) the minimum-$\chi^2$ SED fitting method is
extremely efficient but reaches 0.7 mag. less deep than the BMC method, and
selects only one of the four known quasars. We show that BMC candidates,
rejected because their photometric SEDs have high $\chi^2$ values, include
bright examples of galaxies with very strong [OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007
emission in the $Y$ band, identified in fainter surveys by Matsuoka et al. This
is a potential contaminant population in Euclid searches for faint $z&gt;7$
quasars, not previously accounted for, and that requires better
characterisation.

        <strong>Responses of Halo Occupation Distributions: a new ingredient in the halo model &amp; the impact on galaxy bias. (arXiv:2012.04637v2 [astro-ph.CO] UPDATED)</strong>

          <p>Halo occupation distribution (HOD) models describe the number of galaxies
that reside in different haloes, and are widely used in galaxy-halo connection
studies using the halo model (HM). Here, we introduce and study HOD response
functions $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ that describe the response of the HODs to
long-wavelength perturbations $\mathcal{O}$. The linear galaxy bias parameters
$b_\mathcal{O}^g$ are a weighted version of $b_\mathcal{O}^h +
R_\mathcal{O}^g$, where $b_\mathcal{O}^h$ is the halo bias, but the
contribution from $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ is routinely ignored in the literature. We
investigate the impact of this by measuring the $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ in separate
universe simulations of the IllustrisTNG model for three types of
perturbations: total matter perturbations, $\mathcal{O}=\delta_m$; baryon-CDM
compensated isocurvature perturbations, $\mathcal{O}=\sigma$; and potential
perturbations with local primordial non-Gaussianity, $\mathcal{O}\propto f_{\rm
NL}\phi$. Our main takeaway message is that the $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ are not
negligible in general and their size should be estimated on a case-by-case
basis. For stellar-mass selected galaxies, the responses $R_\phi^g$ and
$R_\sigma^g$ are sizeable and cannot be neglected in HM calculations of the
bias parameters $b_\phi^g$ and $b_\sigma^g$; this is relevant for constraint
studies of inflation. On the other hand, we do not detect a strong impact of
the HOD response $R_1^g$ on the linear galaxy bias $b_1^g$. These results can
be explained by the impact that the perturbations have on stellar-to-total-mass
relations. We also look into the impact on the bias of the gas distribution and
find similar conclusions. We show that a single extra parameter describing the
overall amplitude of $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ recovers the measured $b_\mathcal{O}^g$
well, which indicates that $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ can be easily added to HM/HOD
studies as a new ingredient.

        <strong>Exploring the self-tuning of the cosmological constant from Planck mass variation. (arXiv:2012.01838v1 [gr-qc] CROSS LISTED)</strong>

          <p>Recently, the variation of the Planck mass in the General Relativistic
Einstein-Hilbert action was proposed as a self-tuning mechanism of the
cosmological constant, preventing Standard Model vacuum energy from freely
gravitating and enabling an estimation of the magnitude of its observed value.
We explore here new aspects of this proposal. We first develop an equivalent
Einstein-frame formalism to the current Jordan-frame formulation of the
mechanism and use this to highlight similarities and differences of self-tuning
to the sequestering mechanism. We then show how with an extension of the local
self-tuning action by a coupled Gauss-Bonnet term and a companion four-form
field strength, graviton loops can be prevented from incapacitating the
degravitation of the Standard Model vacuum energy. For certain cases, we
furthermore find that this extension can be recast as a Horndeski scalar-tensor
theory and be embedded in the conventional local self-tuning formalism. We then
explore the possibility of a unification of inflation with self-tuning. The
resulting equations can alternatively be used to motivate a multiverse
interpretation. In this context, we revisit the coincidence problem and provide
an estimation for the probability of the emergence of intelligent life in our
Universe as a function of cosmic age, inferred from star and terrestrial planet
formation processes. We conclude that we live at a very typical epoch, where we
should expect the energy densities of the cosmological constant and matter to
be of comparable size. For a dimensionless quantity to meaningfully compare the
emergence of life throughout the cosmic history of different universes in an
anthropic analysis of the multiverse, we introduce the order of magnitude
difference of the evolving horizon size of a universe to the size of its proton
as the basic building block of atoms, molecules, and eventually life.

          <p>When faced with two nigh intractable problems in cosmology -- how to remove
the original cosmological constant problem and how to parametrize modified
gravity to explain current cosmic acceleration -- we can make progress by
counterposing them. The well tempered solution to the cosmological constant
through degenerate scalar field dynamics also relates disparate Horndeski
gravity terms, making them contrapuntal. We derive the connection between the
kinetic term $K$ and braiding term $G_3$ for shift symmetric theories
(including the running Planck mass $G_4$), extending previous work on monomial
or binomial dependence to polynomials of arbitrary finite degree. We also
exhibit an example for an infinite series expansion. This contrapuntal
condition greatly reduces the number of parameters needed to test modified
gravity against cosmological observations, for these "golden" theories of
gravity.

          <p>We show that warm inflation can be realized within a minimal extension of the
Standard Model with three right-handed neutrinos, three complex scalars and a
gauged lepton/B-L U(1) symmetry. This simple model can address all the
shortcomings of the Standard Model that are not related to fine-tuning, within
general relativity, with distinctive experimental signatures that can be probed
in the near future. The inflaton field emerges from the collective breaking of
the U(1) symmetry, and interacts with two of the right-handed neutrinos,
sustaining a high-temperature radiation bath during inflation. The discrete
interchange symmetry of the model protects the scalar potential against large
thermal corrections and leads to a stable inflaton remnant at late times which
can account for dark matter. Consistency of the model and agreement with Cosmic
Microwave Background observations naturally yield light neutrino masses below
0.1 eV, while thermal leptogenesis occurs naturally after a smooth exit from
inflation into the radiation era.
