          <p>Dark matter-only simulations are able to produce the cosmic structure of a
$\Lambda$CDM universe, at a much lower computational cost than more physically
motivated hydrodynamical simulations. However, it is not clear how well smaller
substructure is reproduced by dark matter-only simulations. To investigate
this, we directly compare the substructure of galaxy clusters and of
surrounding galaxy groups in hydrodynamical and dark matter-only simulations.
We utilise TheThreeHundred project, a suite of 324 simulations of galaxy
clusters that have been simulated with hydrodynamics, and in dark matter-only.
We find that dark matter-only simulations underestimate the number density of
galaxies in the centres of groups and clusters relative to hydrodynamical
simulations, and that this effect is stronger in denser regions. We also look
at the phase space of infalling galaxy groups, to show that dark matter-only
simulations underpredict the number density of galaxies in the centres of these
groups by about a factor of four. This implies that the structure and evolution
of infalling groups may be different to that predicted by dark matter-only
simulations. Finally, we discuss potential causes for this underestimation,
considering both physical effects, and numerical differences in the analysis.

          <p>This work introduces an unbiased minimum variance painting of the pixel
domain CMB maps for both the missing and available sky regions. In the missing
region, it generates CMB realizations that have identical statistical
properties to the expected CMB signal; and in the available region, it
significantly alleviate the unwanted residuals, e.g., the residual of
EB-leakage. The time cost of this method follows $\sim$$ O(N_{side}^3)$
($N_{side}$ is the map resolution parameter), which is similar to the fast
spherical harmonic transforms and is much better than the traditional minimum

a series of minimum variance estimations for analyzing CMB datasets, and more

          <p>Context: Fast radio bursts are transient radio pulses of extragalactic
origin. Their dispersion measure is indicative of the baryon content in the
ionized intergalactic medium between the source and the observer. However,
inference using unlocalized fast radio bursts is degenerate to the distribution
of redshifts of host galaxies. Method: We perform a joint inference of the
intergalactic baryon content and the fast radio burst redshift distribution
with the use of Bayesian statistics by comparing the likelihood of different
models to reproduce the observed statistics in order to infer the most likely
models. In addition to two models of the intergalactic medium, we consider
contributions from the local environment of the source, assumed to be a
magnetar, as well as a representative ensemble of host and intervening
galaxies. Results: Assuming that the missing baryons reside in the ionized
intergalactic medium, our results suggest that the redshift distribution of
observed fast radio bursts peaks at $z \lesssim 0.6$. However, conclusions from
different instruments regarding the intergalactic baryon content diverge and
thus require additional changes to the observed distribution of host redshifts,
beyond those caused by telescope selection effects.

          <p>The shorten sound horizon scale at the recombination epoch by introducing
extra energy components such as the extra radiation or early dark energy (EDE)
is a simple approach to so-called the Hubble tension. We compare EDE models, an
extra radiation model and an EDE and extra radiation co-existing model with
paying attention to the fit to big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). We find that a
fit to BBN in EDE models also is somewhat poorer than that in the $\Lambda$CDM

deuterium abundance. We find that an extra radiation-EDE co-existing model

also the examine data sets dependence, whether we include BBN or not. The
difference in an extra radiation model is $3.22 &lt; N_\mathrm{eff} &lt; 3.49 \,(68

          <p>We explore the possibility of constraining model parameters of the Epoch of
Reionization (EoR) from 21cm brightness temperature maps, using a combination
of morphological descriptors constructed from the eigenvalues of the Contour
Minkowski Tensor (CMT), Betti numbers (count of connected regions $n_{con}$ and
holes $n_{hole}$) and the area of structures in the excursion set of the field.
We use a three parameter model of EoR simulated using 21\textrm{cmFAST}, namely
the ionizing efficiency of sources $\zeta$, the minimum virial temperature
$T_{vir}$ required for collapse into a halo and the maximum radius for ionizing
radiation described by $R_{mfp}$. We performed a Bayesian analysis to recover
model parameters for a mock 21cm image from SKA phase I at a redshift of
$z=7.4$ corresponding to a mean neutral hydrogen fraction of $\mathrm{\bar
x}_{HI} \simeq 0.5$. We find that in the absence of noise the average size of
structures in the field with $x_{HI} \lesssim 0.5$ is smaller than regions with
$x_{HI} \gtrsim 0.5$ and the structures are equally isotropic when
$\mathrm{\bar x}_{HI}=0.5$ . We also find that in order to recover the input
model to within $1-\sigma$ accuracy for a mock noisy image at a single
frequency channel of $1~\mathrm{MHz}$, for an observation time
$t_{obs}&lt;2000~\mathrm{hrs}$, the noisy $\delta T_b$ map needs to be smoothed at
a scale $R_s&gt;9.5~\mathrm{Mpc}$. Finally we show that the systematic behaviour
of the statistic as ionization progresses, enables us to obtain stringent
constraints on $\mathrm{\bar x}_{HI}$ (with a coefficient of variation $\sim
0.05$ as compared to $\sim 0.1-0.2$ for model parameter constraints), thereby
making these descriptors a promising statistic for constraining EoR model
parameters.

          <p>Observations of non-random distribution of galaxies with opposite spin
directions have recently attracted considerable attention. Here, a method for
identifying cosine-dependence in a dataset of galaxies annotated by their spin
directions is described in the light of different aspects that can impact the
statistical analysis of the data. These aspects include the presence of
duplicate objects in a dataset, errors in the galaxy annotation process, and
non-random distribution of the asymmetry that does not necessarily form a
dipole or quadrupole axes. The results show that duplicate objects in the
dataset can artificially increase the likelihood of cosine dependence detected
in the data, but a very high number of duplicate objects is required to lead to
a false detection of an axis. Inaccuracy in galaxy annotations has relatively
minor impact on the identification of cosine dependence when the error is
randomly distributed between clockwise and counterclockwise galaxies. However,
when the error is not random, even a small bias of 1% leads to a statistically
significant cosine dependence that peaks at the celestial pole. Experiments
with artificial datasets in which the distribution was not random showed strong
cosine dependence even when the data did not form a full dipole axis alignment.
The analysis when using the unmodified data shows asymmetry profile similar to
the profile shown in multiple previous studies using several different
telescopes.

          <p>Possible interactions of dark matter (DM) with Standard Model (SM) particles
can be tested with spectral distortions (SDs) of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). In particular, a non-relativistic DM particle that scatters
elastically with photons, electrons or nuclei imprints a negative chemical
potential $\mu$ to the CMB spectrum. This article revisits the first study of
this effect, with an accurate treatment of heat exchange between DM and SM
particles. We show that the instantaneous-decoupling approximation made in the
original study systematically and significantly underestimates the amplitude of
SDs. As a consequence, we derive tighter upper bounds to the DM-SM
elastic-scattering cross section for DM masses $m_\chi \lesssim 0.1$ MeV, from
the non-detection of $\mu$-distortions by FIRAS. We also show that a future
instrument like PIXIE, sensitive to $|\mu| \sim 10^{-8}$, would be able to
probe DM-SM cross sections much smaller than first forecasted, and orders of
magnitude below current upper limits from CMB-anisotropy data, up to DM masses
of $\sim 1$ GeV. Lastly, we study the sensitivity of SDs to the electric and
magnetic dipole moments of the DM. Although SDs can place non-trivial
constraints on these models, we find that even future SD experiments are
unlikely to improve upon the best current bounds. This article is accompanied
by the public code DMDIST, which allows one to compute CMB SDs for generic
particle-DM models, specified by their cross sections for elastic scattering
with and annihilation into SM particles.

          <p>The Parkes, ASKAP, CHIME and UTMOST telescopes, which have all detected FRBs,
each works at a different frequency and has a different detection criteria.
Using simulations, we have combined the constraints from all four telescopes to
identify an allowed range of model parameters $(\alpha, \E33)$ for the FRB
source population. Here $\alpha$ is the spectral index and $\E33$ is the mean
FRB energy in units of $10^{33} \, {\rm J}$ across a $2128 - 2848\; {\rm MHz}$
band in the FRB rest frame. We have considered several different FRB energy
distributions, and also different scenarios for the scattering pulse
broadening, the event rate density variation with $z$ and the host dispersion
measure. We find that in all cases, the common allowed region includes the
range $-3.9\leq\alpha\leq-1.3$ and $0.42\leq\E33\leq1$. In all case, large
values $\alpha &gt; 4$ and $\E33 &gt;60$ are ruled out. Considering the allowed
$(\alpha, \E33)$ parameter range, we predict that CHIME is unlikely to detect
an FRB with extra-galactic dispersion measure $(DM_{Ex})$ exceeding $3700\,{\rm
pc\,cm}^{-3}$. A substantially larger $DM_{Ex}$ in the large FRB sample
anticipated from CHIME would falsify the assumptions of the present analysis.
Our analysis is expected to yield tighter parameter constraints with the advent
of more FRB data.

          <p>We introduce The Novel Probes Project, an initiative to advance the field of
astrophysical tests of the dark sector by creating a forum that connects
observers and theorists. This review focuses on tests of gravity and is
intended to be of use primarily to observers, but also to theorists with
interest in the development of experimental tests. It is twinned with a
separate review on tests of dark matter self-interactions (Adhikari et al., in
prep.).
</p>
<p>Our focus is on astrophysical probes of gravity in the weak-field regime,
ranging from stars to quasilinear cosmological scales. These are complementary
to both strong-field tests and background and linear probes in cosmology. In
particular, the nonlinear screening mechanisms that are an integral part of
viable modified gravity models lead to characteristic signals specifically on
astrophysical scales. The constraining power of these signals is not limited by
cosmic variance, but comes with the challenge of building robust theoretical
models of the nonlinear dynamics of stars, galaxies, clusters and large scale
structure.
</p>
<p>In this review we lay the groundwork for a thorough exploration of the
astrophysical regime with an eye to using the current and next generation of
observations for tests of gravity. We begin by setting the scene for how
theories beyond General Relativity are expected to behave, focusing primarily
on screened fifth forces. We describe the analytic and numerical techniques for
exploring the pertinent astrophysical systems, as well as the signatures of
modified gravity. With these in hand we present a range of observational tests,
and discuss prospects for future measurements and theoretical developments.

          <p>New interactions of neutrinos can stop them from free streaming even after
the weak interaction freeze-out. This results in a phase shift in the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) acoustic peaks which can alleviate the Hubble
tension. In addition, the perturbations in neutrinos do not decay away on
horizon entry and contribute to metric perturbation enhancing the matter power
spectrum. We demonstrate that this acoustic phase shift can be achieved using
new interactions of standard left-handed neutrinos with dark matter without
changing the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom. Using Planck
CMB and the WiggleZ galaxy survey $ (k\le 0.12 h \ {\rm Mpc}^{-1} ) $ data, we
demonstrate that in this model the Hubble tension reduces to approximately $
2.1 \sigma$. Our model predicts potentially observable modifications of the CMB
B-modes and the matter power spectrum that can be observed in future data sets.

equations that govern most of the N-body simulations to model the dark matter.
We describe the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method used for simulating the
gas, star dynamics and structure formation in these simulations. Then,
cautiously, we guide the reader to the installation of GADGET-2 on a
Linux-based computer, as well as to carry out a couple of examples to operate

a large structure simulation, analyse the outputs to display the matter power

          <p>The power spectrum has long been the workhorse summary statistics for
large-scale structure cosmological analyses. However, gravitational non-linear
evolution moves precious cosmological information from the two-point statistics
(such as the power spectrum) to higher-order correlations. Moreover,
information about the primordial non-Gaussian signal lies also in higher-order
correlations. Without tapping into these, that information remains hidden.
While the three-point function (or the bispectrum), even if not extensively,
has been studied and applied to data, there has been only limited discussion
about the four point/trispectrum. This is because the high-dimensionality of
the statistics (in real space a skew-quadrilateral has 6 degrees of freedom),
and the high number of skew-quadrilaterals, make the trispectrum numerically
and algorithmically very challenging. Here we address this challenge by
introducing the i-trispectrum, an integrated trispectrum that only depends on
four $k$-modes moduli. We model and measure the matter i-trispectrum from a set
of 5000 \textsc{Quijote} N-body simulations both in real and redshift space,
finding good agreement between simulations outputs and model up to mildly
non-linear scales. Using the power spectrum, bispectrum and i-trispectrum joint
data-vector covariance matrix estimated from the simulations, we begin to
quantify the added-value provided by the i-trispectrum. In particular, we
forecast the i-trispectrum improvements on constraints on the local primordial
non-Gaussianity amplitude parameters $f_\mathrm{nl}$ and $g_\mathrm{nl}$. For
example, using the full joint data-vector, we forecast $f_\mathrm{nl}$
constraints up to two times ($\sim32\%$) smaller in real (redshift) space than
those obtained without i-trispectrum.

          <p>Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emitting galaxies are powerful tools to probe the
late stages of cosmic reionization. The observed sudden drop in Ly$\alpha$
fraction at $z&gt;6$ is often interpreted as a sign of reionization, since the
intergalactic medium (IGM) is more neutral and opaque to Ly$\alpha$ photons.
Crucially, this interpretation of the observations is only valid under the
assumption that galaxies themselves experience a minimal evolution at these
epochs. By modelling Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer effects in and around
galaxies, we examine whether a change in the galactic properties can reproduce
the observed drop in the Ly$\alpha$ fraction. We find that an increase in the
galactic neutral hydrogen content or a reduction in the outflow velocity toward
higher redshift both lead to a lower Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, and can thus
mimic an increasing neutral fraction of the IGM. We furthermore find that this
change in galactic properties leads to systematically different Ly$\alpha$
spectra which can be used to differentiate the two competing effects. Using the
CANDELSz7 survey measurements which indicate slightly broader lines at $z\sim
6$, we find that the scenario of a mere increase in the galactic column density
towards higher $z$ is highly unlikely. We also show that a decrease in outflow
velocity is not ruled out by existing data but leads to more prominent blue
peaks at $z&gt;6$. Our results caution the use of Ly$\alpha$ observations to
estimate the IGM neutral fraction without accounting for the potential change
in the galactic properties, e.g., by mapping out the evolution of Ly$\alpha$
spectral characteristics.

between matter and gravity, we obtained the modified slow-roll parameters, the
scalar spectral index ($n_s$), the tensor spectral index ($n_{\textrm{T}}$),
and the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$). We computed these quantities for a
general power-law potential, Natural &amp; Quartic Hilltop inflation, and the

that one of the parameters of Natural/Hilltop models is non-trivially modified.

          <p>Efforts to detect a primordial $B$-mode of CMB polarization generated by
inflationary gravitational waves ought to mitigate the large variance
associated with the $B$-modes produced by gravitational lensing, a process
known as delensing. A popular approach to delensing entails building a lensing
$B$-mode template by mimicking the lensing operation, either at gradient order
or non-perturbatively, using high-resolution $E$-mode observations and some
proxy of the lensing potential. By explicitly calculating all contributions to
two-loop order in lensing to the power spectrum of $B$-modes delensed with such
a template in the noise-free limit, we are able to show that: (i) corrections
to the leading-order calculation of the lensing $B$-mode power spectrum only
enter at the $O(1)\,\%$ level because of extensive cancellations between large
terms at next-to-leading order; (ii) these cancellations would disappear if a
gradient-order template were to be built from unlensed or delensed $E$-modes,
giving rise to a residual delensing floor of $O(10)\,\%$ of the original power;
(iii) new cancellations arise when the lensed $E$-modes are used in the
gradient-order template, allowing for the delensing floor to be as low as
$O(1)\,\%$ of the original power in practical applications of this method; and
(iv) these new cancellations would disappear for a non-perturbative template
constructed from the lensed $E$-modes, reintroducing a residual delensing floor
of $O(10)\,\%$. We further show that the gradient-order template outperforms
the non-perturbative one in realistic scenarios with noisy estimates of the
$E$-mode polarization and lensing potential. We therefore recommend that in
practical applications of $B$-mode template delensing, where the template is
constructed directly from the (filtered) observed $E$-modes, the gradient-order
approach should be used rather than a non-perturbative remapping.

          <p>We investigate linear and non-linear dynamics of spherically symmetric
perturbations on a static configuration in scalar-tensor theories focusing on
the chameleon screening mechanism. We particularly address two questions: how
much the perturbations can source the fifth force when the static background is
well screened, and whether the resultant fifth force can change the stability
and structure of the background configuration. For linear perturbations, we
derive a lower bound for the square of the Fourier mode frequency $\omega^2$
using the adiabatic approximation. There may be unstable modes if this lower
bound is negative, and we find that the condition of the instability can be
changed by the fifth force although this effect is suppressed by the screening
parameter. For non-linear perturbations, because we are mainly interested in
short wavelength modes for which the fifth force may become stronger, we
perform numerical simulations under the planar approximation. For a
sufficiently large initial amplitude of the density perturbation, we find that
the magnitude of the fifth force can be comparable to that of Newtonian gravity
even when the model parameters are chosen so that the static background is well
screened. It is also shown that if the screening is effective for the static
background, the fluid dynamics is mostly governed by the pressure gradient and
is not significantly affected by the fifth force.

          <p>The standard deviation of the initial values of the nondimensional Kerr
parameter $a_{*}$ of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the
radiation-dominated phase of the universe is estimated to the first order of
perturbation for the narrow power spectrum. Evaluating the angular momentum at
turn around based on linearly extrapolated transfer functions and peak theory,
we obtain the expression $\sqrt{\langle a_{*}^{2} \rangle} \simeq 4.0\times
10^{-3} (M/M_{H})^{-1/3}\sqrt{1-\gamma^{2}}[1-0.072
\log_{10}(\beta_{0}(M_{H})/(1.3\times 10^{-15}))]^{-1}$, where $M_{H}$,
$\beta_{0}(M_{H})$, and $\gamma$ are the mass within the Hubble horizon at the
horizon entry of the overdense region, the fraction of the universe which
collapsed to PBHs at the scale of $M_{H}$, and a quantity which characterizes
the width of the power spectrum, respectively. This implies that for $M\simeq
M_{H}$, the higher the probability of the PBH formation, the larger the
standard deviation of the spins, while PBHs of $M\ll M_{H}$ formed through
near-critical collapse may have larger spins than those of $M\simeq M_{H}$. In
comparison to the previous estimate, the new estimate has the explicit
dependence on the ratio $M/M_{\rm H}$ and no direct dependence on the current
dark matter density. On the other hand, it suggests that the first-order effect
can be numerically comparable to the second-order one.

          <p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) might be formed in the early Universe and could
comprise at least a fraction of the dark matter. Using the recently released
GWTC-2 dataset from the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration, we
investigate whether current observations are compatible with the hypothesis
that all black hole mergers detected so far are of primordial origin. We
constrain PBH formation models within a hierarchical Bayesian inference
framework based on deep learning techniques, finding best-fit values for
distinctive features of these models, including the PBH initial mass function,
the fraction of PBHs in dark matter, and the accretion efficiency. The presence
of several spinning binaries in the GWTC-2 dataset favors a scenario in which
PBHs accrete and spin up. Our results indicate that PBHs may comprise only a
fraction smaller than $0.3 \%$ of the total dark matter, and that the predicted
PBH abundance is still compatible with other constraints.

          <p>Self-interaction in the active neutrinos is studied in the literature to
alleviate the $H_0$ tension. Similar self-interaction can also explain the
observed dips in the flux of the neutrinos coming from the distant
astro-physical sources in IceCube detectors. In contrast to the flavour
universal neutrino interaction considered for solving the $H_0$ tension, which
is ruled out from particle physics experiments, we consider flavour specific
neutrino interactions. We show that the values of self-interaction coupling
constant and mediator mass required for explaining the IceCube dips are
inconsistent with the strong neutrino self-interactions preferred by the
combination of BAO, HST and Planck data. However, the required amount of
self-interaction between tau neutrinos ($\nu_\tau$) in inverted hierarchy for
explaining IceCube dips is consistent with the moderate self-interaction region
of cosmological bounds at 1-$\sigma$ level. For the case of other interactions
and hierarchies, the IceCube preferred amount of self-interaction is consistent
with moderate self-interaction region of cosmological bounds at 2-$\sigma$
level only.

          <p>Lagrangian algorithms to simulate the evolution of cold dark matter (CDM) are
invaluable tools to generate large suites of mock halo catalogues. However,
their precision may not be up to the challenge of upcoming surveys. In this
paper, we first show that the main limitation of current schemes is their
inability to model the evolution of overdensities in the initial density field,
a limit that can be circumvented by detecting halo particles in the initial
conditions. We thus propose a new scheme, dubbed \muscleups, which reproduces
the results from Lagrangian perturbation theory on large scales, while
improving the modelling of the overdensities on small scales. \muscleups\ uses
the extended Press and Schechter (EPS) formalism, adapted to a Lagrangian
picture. For regions exceeding a collapse threshold in the density smoothed at
a radius $R$, we consider all particles within a radius $R$ collapsed.
Exploiting a multi-scale smoothing of the initial density, we build a halo
catalogue on the fly by optimizing the selection of halo candidates. This
allows us to generate a density field with a halo mass function that matches
one measured in $N$-body simulations. We further explicitly gather particles in
each halo together in a profile, providing a numerical, Lagrangian-based
implementation of the halo model. Compared to previous semi-analytical
Lagrangian methods, we find that \muscleups\ improves the recovery of the
statistics of the density field at the level of the probability density
function (PDF), the power spectrum, and the cross correlation with the $N$-body
result.

nucleons in the XENON1T, CRESST-III, CDEX-1B and DarkSide-50 experiments. We
resolve the recent XENON1T anomaly via electron recoil detection. Combining the
XENON1T constraints from both electron recoils and nucleon recoils (including
Migdal effect), we predict the inelastic DM mass $\lesssim\!1\,$GeV. We further
analyze the limits by the DM relic abundance, the lifetime of the heavier DM
component, the collider searches, and the electroweak precision tests, with
which we identify the viable parameter space of the GeV scale inelastic DM.
