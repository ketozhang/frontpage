          <p>In this paper we show how the solar system, the galactic, and the
cosmological scales, are accommodated in a single framework, namely, in the
derivative expansion framework. We construct a locally inertial static metric,
based on the Einstein equations and on the derivative expansion method, which
describes a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in dark matter and dark energy.
The leading order metric in the expansion corresponds to the solar system, the
first order metric to the galaxy, and the second order metric to cosmology. It
is shown how this metric captures the main observations at each scale: in the
solar system it trivially gives the Keplerian physics, in the galaxy it gives
the flat part of the rotation curve and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, and
in the cosmological scale it gives the cosmological redshift, the accelerating
expansion, and it coincides with the Robertson-Walker spacetime in the
appropriate limit and approximation.

Verification phase. In the 140 deg2 eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey
(eFEDS) field we detect a previously unknown supercluster consisting of a chain
of eight galaxy clusters at z=0.36. The redshifts of these members are
determined through HSC photometric measurements. We examine the X-ray
morphological and dynamical properties, gas and total mass out to R500 of the
members and compare them with the general population of clusters detected in
the eFEDS field. We further investigate the gas in the bridge region between
the cluster members for a potential WHIM detection. Radio follow-up
observations with LOFAR and uGMRT are used to search for diffuse emission and
constrain the dynamic state of the system. We do not find significant
differences in the morphological parameters and properties of the intra-cluster
medium of the clusters embedded in this large-scale filament compared to eFEDS
clusters. We also provide upper limits on the electron number density and mass
of the warm-hot intergalactic medium as provided by the eROSITA data. These
limits are consistent with previously reported values for the detections in the
vicinity of clusters of galaxies. In LOFAR and uGMRT follow-up observations of
the northern part of this supercluster we find two new radio relics that are
the result of major merger activity in the system. These early results show the
potential of eROSITA to probe large-scale structures such as superclusters and
the properties of their members. Our forecasts show that we will be able to
detect 450 superclusters with 3000 member clusters located in the eROSITA_DE

          <p>We review (and extend) the analysis of general theories of all interactions
(gravity included) where the mass scales are due to dimensional transmutation.
Quantum consistency requires the presence of terms in the action with four
derivatives of the metric. It is shown, nevertheless, how unitary is achieved
and the classical Ostrogradsky instabilities can be avoided. The
four-derivative terms also allow us to have a UV complete framework and a
naturally small ratio between the Higgs mass and the Planck scale. Moreover,
black holes of Einstein gravity with horizons smaller than a certain
(microscopic) scale are replaced by horizonless ultracompact objects that are
free from any singularity and have interesting phenomenological applications.
We also discuss the predictions that can be compared with observations of the
microwave background radiation anisotropies and find that this scenario is
viable and can be tested with future data. Finally, how strong phase
transitions can emerge in models of this type with approximate scale symmetry
and how to test them with GW detectors is reviewed and explained.

          <p>We present a study of the 21-cm signal bispectrum (which quantifies the
non-Gaussianity in the signal) from the Cosmic Dawn (CD). For our analysis, we
have simulated the 21-cm signal using radiative transfer code GRIZZLY, while
considering two types of sources (mini-QSOs and HMXBs) for Ly$\alpha$ coupling
and the X-ray heating of the IGM. Using this simulated signal, we have, for the
first time, estimated the CD 21-cm bispectra for all unique $k$-triangles and
for a range of $k$ modes. We observe that the redshift evolution of the
bispectra magnitude and sign follow a generic trend for both source models.
However, the redshifts at which the bispectra magnitude reach their maximum and
minimum values and show their sign reversal depends on the source model. When
the Ly$\alpha$ coupling and the X-ray heating of the IGM occur simultaneously,
we observe two consecutive sign reversals in the bispectra for small
$k$-triangles (irrespective of the source models). One arising at the beginning
of the IGM heating and the other at the end of Ly$\alpha$ coupling saturation.
This feature can be used in principle to constrain the CD history and/or to
identify the specific CD scenarios. We also quantify the impact of the spin
temperature ($T_{\rm S}$) fluctuations on the bispectra. We find that $T_{\rm
S}$ fluctuations have maximum impact on the bispectra magnitude for small
$k$-triangles and at the stage when Ly$\alpha$ coupling reaches saturation.
Furthermore, we are also the first to quantify the impact of redshift space
distortions (RSD), on the CD bispectra. We find that the impact of RSD on the
CD 21-cm bispectra is significant ($&gt; 20\%$) and the level depends on the
stages of the CD and the $k$-triangles for which the bispectra are being
estimated.

          <p>In this series of lectures, I review our observational understanding of
high-$z$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) and relevant scientific topics. Since the
discovery of LAEs in the late 1990s, more than ten (one) thousand(s) of LAEs
have been identified photometrically (spectroscopically) at $z\sim 0$ to $z\sim
10$. These large samples of LAEs are useful to address two major astrophysical
issues, galaxy formation and cosmic reionization. Statistical studies have
revealed the general picture of LAEs' physical properties: young stellar
populations, remarkable luminosity function evolutions, compact morphologies,
highly ionized inter-stellar media (ISM) with low metal/dust contents, low
masses of dark-matter halos. Typical LAEs represent low-mass high-$z$ galaxies,
high-$z$ analogs of dwarf galaxies, some of which are thought to be candidates
of population III galaxies. These observational studies have also pinpointed
rare bright Ly$\alpha$ sources extended over $\sim 10-100$ kpc, dubbed
Ly$\alpha$ blobs, whose physical origins are under debate. LAEs are used as
probes of cosmic reionization history through the Ly$\alpha$ damping wing
absorption given by the neutral hydrogen of the inter-galactic medium (IGM),
which complement the cosmic microwave background radiation and 21cm
observations. The low-mass and highly-ionized population of LAEs can be major
sources of cosmic reionization. The budget of ionizing photons for cosmic
reionization has been constrained, although there remain large observational
uncertainties in the parameters. Beyond galaxy formation and cosmic
reionization, several new usages of LAEs for science frontiers have been
suggested such as the distribution of {\sc Hi} gas in the circum-galactic
medium and filaments of large-scale structures. On-going programs and future
telescope projects, such as JWST, ELTs, and SKA, will push the horizons of the
science frontiers.

neutrino self-interactions using cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon
acoustic oscillation data. We consider different scenarios for neutrino
self-interactions distinguished by the fraction of neutrino states allowed to
participate in self-interactions and how the relativistic energy density,
N$_{\textrm{eff}}$, is allowed to vary. Specifically, we study cases in which:
all neutrino states self-interact and N$_{\textrm{eff}}$ varies; two species
free-stream, which we show alleviates tension with laboratory constraints,
while the energy in the additional interacting states varies; and a variable
fraction of neutrinos self-interact with either the total N$_{\textrm{eff}}$
fixed to the Standard Model value or allowed to vary. In no case do we find
compelling evidence for new neutrino interactions or non-standard values of
N$_{\textrm{eff}}$. In several cases we find additional modes with neutrino
decoupling occurring at lower redshifts $z_{\textrm{dec}} \sim 10^{3-4}$. We do
a careful analysis to examine whether new neutrino self-interactions solve or
alleviate the so-called $H_0$ tension and find that, when all Planck 2018 CMB
temperature and polarization data is included, none of these examples ease the
tension more than allowing a variable N$_{\textrm{eff}}$ comprised of
free-streaming particles. Although we focus on neutrino interactions, these
constraints are applicable to any light relic particle.

the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background at a frequency

Model (SM) gauge singlet fermion $\chi$ and a singlet scalar $\phi$, both
charged under a $Z_4$ symmetry, is capable of generating such a low frequency
GW via strong first order phase transition (SFOPT) through the modification of
the standard cosmological history, where we assume faster-than-usual expansion
at pre-BBN times driven by a new cosmological species $\varphi$ whose energy
density red-shifts with the scale factor as $\rho_\varphi\propto
a^{-\left(4+n\right)}$. Depending on the choice of the fast expansion
parameters, reheat temperature and effective scale of the theory, it is also
possible to address correct dark matter (DM) relic abundance via freeze-in. We
show that a successful first order phase transition explaining NANOGrav results
together with PLANCK observed DM abundance put bound on the fast expansion

primordial black hole (PBH) binaries with electromagnetic (EM) detectors of
high-frequency GWs is investigated. We consider two patented experimental
designs, based on the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, in which incoming GWs
passing through a static magnetic field induce EM excitations inside either a
TM cavity or a TEM waveguide. The frequency response of the detectors is
computed for post-newtonian GW waveforms. We find that such EM detectors based
on current technology may achieve a strain sensitivity down to $h \sim
10^{-30}$, which generates an EM power variation of $10^{-10}$ W. This allows
the detection of PBH binary mergers of mass around $10^{-5} M_\odot$ if they
constitute more than $0.01$ percent of the dark matter, as suggested by recent
microlensing observations. We envision that this class of detectors could also

          <p>We consider a cosmological scenario where the dark sector is described by two
perfect fluids that interact through a velocity-dependent coupling. This
coupling gives rise to an interaction in the dark sector driven by the relative
velocity of the components, thus making the background evolution oblivious to
the interaction and only the perturbed Euler equations are affected at first
order. We obtain the equations governing this system with the Schutz-Sorkin
Lagrangian formulation for perfect fluids and derive the corresponding
stability conditions to avoid ghosts and Laplacian instabilities. As a
particular example, we study a model where dark energy behaves as a radiation
fluid at high redshift while it effectively becomes a cosmological constant in
the late Universe. Within this scenario, we show that the interaction of both
dark components leads to a suppression of the dark matter clustering at late

          <p>We study the angular correlation function of star-forming galaxies and
properties of their host dark matter halos at $z&gt;1$ using the Subaru
Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) survey. We use [OII] emitters identified using two
narrow-band (NB) filters, NB816 and NB921, in the Deep/UltraDeep layers, which
respectively cover large angular areas of $16.3 ~{\rm deg}^2$ and $16.9~{\rm
deg}^2$. Our sample contains 8302 and 9578 [OII] emitters at $z=1.19$ (NB816)
and $z=1.47$ (NB921), respectively. We detect a strong clustering signal over a
wide angular range, $0.001 &lt; \theta &lt; 1$ [deg], with the bias
$b=1.61^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$ ($z=1.19$) and $b=2.09^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$ ($z=1.47$). We
also find the clear deviation of the correlation from a simple power-law form.
To interpret the measured clustering signal, we adopt a halo occupation
distribution (HOD) model which is constructed to explain the spatial
distribution of galaxies selected by a star formation rate. The observed
correlation function and number density are simultaneously explained by the
best-fitting HOD model. From the constrained HOD model, the average mass of
halos hosting the [OII] emitters is derived to be $\log{M_{\rm
</p>
<p>eff}/(h^{-1}M_\odot)}=12.70^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ and $12.61^{+0.09}_{-0.05}$ at
$z=1.19$ and $1.47$, respectively, which will become halos with the present-day
mass, $M\sim 1.5 \times 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$. The satellite fraction of the
[OII] emitter sample is found to be $f_{\rm sat}\sim 0.15$. All these values
are consistent with the previous studies of similar samples, but we obtain
tighter constraints due to the high number density and large angular coverage
of our sample. The results obtained for host halos of [OII] emitters in this
paper are expected to be applicable to upcoming emission line galaxy surveys
such as the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph survey.

          <p>Hydroxyl ($\rm OH$) is known to form efficiently in cold gas ($T\sim 100$K)
along with the molecule $\rm H_2$ and can be used as an efficient tracer of the
diffuse molecular gas in the interstellar medium (ISM). Using a simple
formalism describing the $\rm H\,I/H_2$ transition and a reduced network of
major chemical reactions, we present a semi-analytical prescription to estimate
the abundances of O-bearing molecules in the diffuse ISM. We show that
predictions based on our prescription are in good agreement with the estimates
obtained using the MEUDON PDR code which utilizes the full reaction network. We
investigate the dependence of the relative abundances of $\rm OH/H\,I$ and $\rm
OH/H_2$ on the variations of physical conditions i.e., the metallicity, number
density ($n$), cosmic ray ionization rate ($\zeta$) and strength of UV field
($\chi$) in the medium. We find that the $\rm OH/H\,I$ abundances observed in
the Galactic ISM can be reproduced by models with $n\sim 50$cm$^{-3}$,
$\chi\sim 1$ (Mathis field) and $\zeta\sim3\times10^{-17}$s$^{-1}$, with a
variation of about one dex allowed around these values. Using the constrained
$\rm H_2$ column density distribution function at $z\sim3$, we estimate the
$\rm OH$ column density distribution function and discuss future prospects with
the upcoming large radio absorption line surveys.

          <p>We present Suzaku off-center observations of two poor galaxy groups, NGC 3402
and NGC 5129, with temperatures below 1 keV. Through spectral decomposition, we
measured their surface brightnesses and temperatures out to 530 and 1430 times
the critical density of the universe for NGC 3402 and NGC 5129, respectively.
These quantities are consistent with extrapolations from existing inner
measurements of the two groups. With the refined bolometric X-ray luminosities,
both groups prefer $L_X$-$T$ relations without a break in the group regime.
Furthermore, we have determined the electron number densities and hydrostatic
masses at these radii. We found that the surface brightness and electron number
density profiles require two $\beta$ model components, as well as the
indication that a third $\beta$ model may be needed for NGC 3402. Adding the
gas mass measured from the X-ray data and stellar mass from group galaxy
members, we computed baryon fractions of $f_b$ = 0.0693 $\pm$ 0.0068 and $f_b$
= 0.095 $\pm$ 0.014 for NGC 3402 and NGC 5129, respectively. Combining other
poor groups with well-measured X-ray emission to the outskirts, we found an
average baryon fraction extrapolated to $r_{500}$ of $\overline{f_{b,500}}$ =
0.0912 $\pm$ 0.0050 for X-ray-bright groups with temperatures between 0.8 and
1.3 keV, extending existing constraints to lower-mass systems and indicating
that significant baryon losses exist below approximately $r_{500}$.

          <p>We demonstrate the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
mitigate systematics in the virial scaling relation and produce dynamical mass
estimates of galaxy clusters with remarkably low bias and scatter. We present
two models, CNN$_\mathrm{1D}$ and CNN$_\mathrm{2D}$, which leverage this deep
learning tool to infer cluster masses from distributions of member galaxy
dynamics. Our first model, CNN$_\text{1D}$, infers cluster mass directly from
the distribution of member galaxy line-of-sight velocities. Our second model,
CNN$_\text{2D}$, extends the input space of CNN$_\text{1D}$ to learn on the
joint distribution of galaxy line-of-sight velocities and projected radial
distances. We train each model as a regression over cluster mass using a
labeled catalog of realistic mock cluster observations generated from the
MultiDark simulation and UniverseMachine catalog. We then evaluate the
performance of each model on an independent set of mock observations selected
from the same simulated catalog. The CNN models produce cluster mass
predictions with lognormal residuals of scatter as low as $0.132$ dex, greater
than a factor of 2 improvement over the classical $M$-$\sigma$ power-law
estimator. Furthermore, the CNN model reduces prediction scatter relative to
similar machine learning approaches by up to $17\%$ while executing in
drastically shorter training and evaluation times (by a factor of 30) and
producing considerably more robust mass predictions (improving prediction
stability under variations in galaxy sampling rate by $30\%$).

parameters beyond percent level. To match this precision, theoretical
descriptions should look beyond the linear perturbations to approximate the
observables in large scale structure. A quantity of interest is the Number
density of galaxies detected by our instruments. This has been focus of
interest recently, and several efforts have been made to explain relativistic
effects theoretically, thereby testing the full theory. However, the results at
nonlinear level from previous works are in disagreement. We present a new and

second order in cosmological perturbation theory. We derive analytical
expressions for the full second order relativistic observed redshift, for the

an observable stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background when they begin to
oscillate in the early universe. In this note, we identify the regions of ALP
parameter space which may be probed by future GW detectors, including ground-
and space-based interferometers and pulsar timing arrays. Interestingly, these
experiments have the ability to probe axions from the bottom up, i.e. in the
very weakly coupled regime which is otherwise unconstrained. Furthermore, we
discuss the effects of finite dark photon mass and kinetic mixing on the
mechanism, as well as the (in)sensitivity to couplings of the axion to Standard
Model fields. We conclude that realistic axion and ALP scenarios may indeed be
probed by GW experiments in the future, and provide signal templates for

produced that is proportional to the square as opposed to the fourth power of
the ALP-photon coupling constant. Assuming shot noise to be the dominant source
of noise, we estimate that this approach is sensitive ALP masses less than

          <p>In this work, we achieve the determination of the cosmic curvature $\Omega_K$
in a cosmological model-independent way, by using the Hubble parameter
measurements $H(z)$ and type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). In our analysis, two
nonlinear interpolating tools are used to reconstruct the Hubble parameter, one
is the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method, and the other is the Gaussian
process (GP) method. We find that $\Omega_K$ based on the GP method can be
greatly influenced by the prior of $H_0$, while the ANN method can overcome
this. Therefore, the ANN method may have more advantages than GP in the
measurement of the cosmic curvature. Based on the ANN method, we find a
spatially open universe is preferred by the current $H(z)$ and SNe Ia data, and
the difference between our result and the value inferred from Planck CMB is
$1.6\sigma$. In order to test the reliability of the ANN method, and the
potentiality of the future gravitational waves (GW) standard sirens in the
measurement of the cosmic curvature, we constrain $\Omega_K$ using the
simulated Hubble parameter and GW standard sirens in a model-independent way.
We find that the ANN method is reliable and unbiased, and the error of
$\Omega_K$ is $\sim0.186$ when 100 GW events with electromagnetic counterparts
are detected, which is $\sim56\%$ smaller than that constrained from the
Pantheon SNe Ia. Therefore, the data-driven method based on ANN has potential
in the measurement of the cosmic curvature.

$19 - 190\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. This is the highest-redshift and largest-scale
estimation of $E_G$ so far. We use the quasar sample with redshifts $0.8 &lt; z &lt;
2.2$ from Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (eBOSS) Data Release 16 (DR16) as the large-scale structure (LSS)
tracer, for which the angular power spectrum $C_\ell^{qq}$ and the
redshift-space distortion (RSD) parameter $\beta$ are estimated. By cross
correlating with the $\textit{Planck}$ 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB)
lensing map, we detect the angular cross-power spectrum $C_\ell^{\kappa q}$
signal at $12\,\sigma$ significance. Both jackknife resampling and simulations
are used to estimate the covariance matrix (CM) of $E_G$ at $5$ bins covering
different scales, with the later preferred for its better constraints on the
covariances. We find $E_G$ estimates agree with the GR prediction at
$1\,\sigma$ level over all these scales. With the CM estimated with $300$
simulations, we report a best-fit scale-averaged estimate of
$E_G(\bar{z})=0.30\pm 0.05$, which is in line with the GR prediction $E_G^{\rm
GR}(\bar{z})=0.33$ with $\textit{Planck}$ 2018 CMB+BAO matter density fraction
$\Omega_{\rm m}=0.31$. The statistical errors of $E_G$ with future LSS surveys
at similar redshifts will be reduced by an order of magnitude, which makes it
possible to constrain modified gravity models.

          <p>Now that conventional weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter
searches are approaching the neutrino floor, there has been a resurgence of
interest in detectors with sensitivity to nuclear recoil directions. A
large-scale directional detector is attractive in that it would have
sensitivity below the neutrino floor, be capable of unambiguously establishing
the galactic origin of a purported dark matter signal, and could serve a dual
purpose as a neutrino observatory. We present the first detailed analysis of a
1000 m$^3$-scale detector capable of measuring a directional nuclear recoil
signal at low energies. We propose a modular and multi-site observatory
consisting of time projection chambers (TPCs) filled with helium and SF$_6$ at
atmospheric pressure. Depending on the TPC readout technology, 10-20 helium
recoils above 6 keVr or only 3-4 recoils above 20 keVr would suffice to
distinguish a 10 GeV WIMP signal from the solar neutrino background.
High-resolution charge readout also enables powerful electron background
rejection capabilities well below 10 keV. We detail background and site
requirements at the 1000 m$^3$-scale, and identify materials that require
improved radiopurity. The final experiment, which we name CYGNUS-1000, will be
able to observe 10-40 neutrinos from the Sun, depending on the final energy
threshold. With the same exposure, the sensitivity to spin independent cross
sections will extend into presently unexplored sub-10 GeV parameter space. For
spin dependent interactions, already a 10 m$^3$-scale experiment could compete
with upcoming generation-two detectors, but CYGNUS-1000 would improve upon this
considerably. Larger volumes would bring sensitivity to neutrinos from an even
wider range of sources, including galactic supernovae, nuclear reactors, and
geological processes.

pions in the early Universe at nonvanishing values of lepton flavor
asymmetries. A hadron resonance gas model with pion interactions, based on
first-principle lattice QCD simulations at nonzero isospin density, is used to
evaluate cosmic trajectories at various values of electron, muon, and tau
lepton asymmetries that satisfy the available constraints on the total lepton
asymmetry. The cosmic trajectory can pass through the pion condensed phase if
the combined electron and muon asymmetry is sufficiently large: $|l_e +
l_{\mu}| \gtrsim 0.1$, with little sensitivity to the difference $l_e - l_\mu$
between the individual flavor asymmetries. Future constraints on the values of
the individual lepton flavor asymmetries will thus be able to either confirm or
rule out the condensation of pions during the cosmic QCD epoch. We demonstrate
that the pion condensed phase leaves an imprint both on the spectrum of
primordial gravitational waves and on the mass distribution of primordial black
holes at the QCD scale e.g. the black hole binary of recent LIGO event GW190521

          <p>Weak lensing by large-scale structure is a powerful probe of cosmology if the
apparent alignments in the shapes of distant galaxies can be accurately
measured. Most studies have therefore focused on improving the fidelity of the
shape measurements themselves, but the preceding step of object detection has
been largely ignored. In this paper we study the impact of object detection for
a Euclid-like survey and show that it leads to biases that exceed requirements
for the next generation of cosmic shear surveys. In realistic scenarios,
blending of galaxies is an important source of detection bias. We find that
MetaDetection is able to account for blending, leading to average
multiplicative biases that meet requirements for Stage IV surveys, provided a
sufficiently accurate model for the point spread function is available. Further
work is needed to estimate the performance for actual surveys. Combined with
sufficiently realistic image simulations, this provides a viable way forward
towards accurate shear estimates for Stage IV surveys.

$\alpha_i= \alpha_{i0}~a^s$ where $i=M,B$, $a$ is the scale factor and
$\alpha_{i0}$ ($\alpha_{M0}, \alpha_{B0}$), $s$ are arbitrary parameters. We
show that the growth and lensing reduced (dimensionless) gravitational

exhibit the following generic properties today: $\Sigma_0 &lt; 1$ for all viable

$\mu_0&gt;1$ is favored for large $s$. We establish also the relation $\mu\geq

constrains the parameter $s$ to satisfy $s\lesssim 2$. Hence these data select
essentially the weak gravity regime today ($\mu_0&lt;1$) when $s&lt;2$, while
$\mu_0&gt;1$ subsists only marginally for $s\approx 2$. At least the interval
$0.5\lesssim s \lesssim 2$ would be ruled out in the absence of screening. We

$\gamma_1-\gamma_1^{\Lambda CDM}$, where $\gamma_0\equiv \gamma\bigl|_{z=0}$

important information is gained on the past evolution of $\mu$. We obtain in

          <p>The phase-space structure of primordial dark matter halos is revisited using
cosmological simulations with three sine waves and Cold Dark Matter (CDM)
initial conditions. The simulations are performed with the tessellation based
Vlasov solver ColDICE and a Particle-Mesh (PM) $N$-body code. The analyses
include projected density, phase-space diagrams, radial density and
pseudo-phase space density. Particular attention is paid to force and mass
resolution. Because the phase-space sheet complexity, estimated in terms of
total volume and simplices count, increases very quickly, ColDICE can follow
only the early violent relaxation phase of halo formation. During the latter,
agreement between ColDICE and PM simulations having one particle per cell or
more is excellent and halos have a power-law density profile, $\rho(r) \propto
r^{-\alpha}$, $\alpha \in [1.5,1.8]$. This slope, measured prior to any merger,
is slightly larger than in the literature. The phase-space diagrams evidence
complex but coherent patterns with clear signatures of self-similarity in the
sine wave simulations, while the CDM halos are somewhat scribbly. After
additional mass resolution tests, the PM simulations are used to follow the
next stages of evolution. The power-law progressively breaks down with a
convergence of the density profile to the well known "NFW"-like universal
attractor, irrespectively of initial conditions, that is even in the three-sine
wave simulations. This demonstrates again that mergers do not represent a
necessary condition for convergence to the dynamical attractor. Not
surprisingly, the measured pseudo phase-space density is a power-law $Q(r)
\propto r^{-\alpha_Q}$, with $\alpha_{\rm Q}$ close to the prediction of
secondary spherical infall model, $\alpha_{\rm Q} \simeq 1.875$. However this
property is also verified during the early relaxation phase, which is non
trivial.

study how emission from dark matter annihilation is affected by baryonic
processes. These simulations produce isolated, disc-dominated galaxies with
structure, stellar populations, and stellar and halo masses comparable to those
of the Milky Way. They resolve dark matter structures with mass above $\sim
10^6$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ and are each available in both full-physics and
dark-matter-only versions. In the full-physics case, formation of the stellar
galaxy enhances annihilation radiation from the dominant smooth component of
the galactic halo by a factor of three, and its central concentration increases
substantially. In contrast, subhalo fluxes are $reduced$ by almost an order of
magnitude, partly because of changes in internal structure, partly because of
increased tidal effects; they drop relative to the flux from the smooth halo by
1.5 orders of magnitude. The expected flux from the brightest subhalo is four
orders of magnitude below that from the smooth halo, making it very unlikely
that any subhalo will be detected before robust detection of the inner Galaxy.
We use recent simulations of halo structure across the full $\Lambda$CDM mass
range to extrapolate to the smallest (Earth-mass) subhaloes, concluding, in
contrast to earlier work, that the total annihilation flux from Milky Way
subhaloes will be less than that from the smooth halo, as viewed both from the

radiation from the very brightest subhaloes, which, typically, will contain

Using a variety of new ansatzes for covariance modelling and testing we
validate the assumptions and approximations of this model. These include the
assumption of a Gaussian likelihood, the trispectrum contribution to the
covariance, the impact of evaluating the model at a wrong set of parameters,
the impact of masking and survey geometry, deviations from Poissonian
shot-noise, galaxy weighting schemes and other, sub-dominant effects. We find
that our covariance model is robust and that its approximations have little
impact on goodness-of-fit and parameter estimation. The largest impact on
best-fit figure-of-merit arises from the so-called $f_{\mathrm{sky}}$
approximation for dealing with finite survey area, which on average increases
the $\chi^2$ between maximum posterior model and measurement by $3.7\%$
($\Delta \chi^2 \approx 18.9$). Standard methods to go beyond this
approximation fail for DES-Y3, but we derive an approximate scheme to deal with
these features. For parameter estimation, our ignorance of the exact parameters
at which to evaluate our covariance model causes the dominant effect. We find
that it increases the scatter of maximum posterior values for $\Omega_m$ and

          <p>Stellar streams formed by tidal stripping of progenitors orbiting around the
Milky Way are expected to be perturbed by encounters with dark matter subhalos.
Recent studies have shown that they are an excellent proxy to infer properties
of the perturbers, such as their mass. Here we present two different
methodologies that make use of the fully non-Gaussian density distribution of
stellar streams: a Bayesian model selection based on the probability density
function (PDF) of stellar density, and a likelihood-free gradient boosting
classifier. As an application, we forecast model selection strength of evidence
for cold dark matter clusters of masses $10^3$-$10^5 M_{\odot}$, $10^5$-$10^7
M_{\odot}$ and $10^7$-$10^9 M_{\odot}$, based on a GD-1-like stellar stream and
including realistic observational errors. Evidence for the smaller mass range,
so far under-explored, is particularly interesting for the primordial black
holes cold dark matter hypothesis. We expect moderate to strong evidence for
model selection based on the PDF analysis when assuming low and intermediate
dark matter perturbers mass ranges as fiducial models, but only weak evidence
when the larger mass range is taken to be the fiducial model. Instead, the
gradient boosting model is a highly efficient classifier ($F_1$-scores larger
than 90%) for all mass ranges here considered.
