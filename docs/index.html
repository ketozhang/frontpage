          <p>Minkowski functionals (MFs) are a set of statistics that characterise the
geometry and topology of the cosmic density field and contain complementary
information to the standard two-point analyses. We present MEDUSA, an
implementation of an accurate method for estimating the MFs of
three-dimensional point distributions. These estimates are inferred from
triangulated isodensity surfaces that are constructed from the Delaunay
tessellation of the input point sample. Contrary to previous methods, MEDUSA
can account for periodic boundary conditions, which is crucial for the analysis
of N-body simulations. We validate our code against several test samples with
known MFs, including Gaussian random fields with a ${\Lambda}$CDM power
spectrum, and find excellent agreement with the theory predictions. We use
MEDUSA to measure the MFs of synthetic galaxy catalogues constructed from
N-body simulations. Our results show clearly non-Gaussian signatures that arise
from the non-linear gravitational evolution of the density field. We find that,
although redshift-space distortions significantly change our MFs estimates,
their impact is considerably reduced if these measurements are expressed as a
function of the volume-filling fraction. We also show that the effect of
Alcock-Paczynski (AP) distortions on the MFs can be described by scaling them
with different powers of the isotropic AP parameter $q$ defined in terms of the
volume-averaged distance $D_{\rm V}(z)$. Thus the MFs estimates by MEDUSA are
useful probes of non-linearities in the density field, and the expansion and
growth of structure histories of the Universe.

Telescope (HST) photometry and Gaia EDR3 parallaxes which we use to recalibrate
the extragalactic distance ladder and refine the determination of the Hubble
constant. All HST observations were obtained with the same instrument (WFC3)
and filters (F555W, F814W, F160W) used for imaging of extragalactic Cepheids in
Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) hosts. The HST observations used the WFC3 spatial
scanning mode to mitigate saturation and reduce pixel-to-pixel calibration
errors, reaching a mean photometric error of 5 millimags per observation. We
use new Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, vastly improved since DR2, and the
Period-Luminosity (PL) relation of these Cepheids to simultaneously calibrate
the extragalactic distance ladder and to refine the determination of the Gaia
EDR3 parallax offset. The resulting geometric calibration of Cepheid
luminosities has 1.0% precision, better than any alternative geometric anchor.
Applied to the calibration of SNe~Ia, it results in a measurement of the Hubble
constant of 73.0 +/- 1.4 km/sec/Mpc, in good agreement with conclusions based
on earlier Gaia data releases. We also find the slope of the Cepheid PL
relation in the Milky Way, and the metallicity dependence of its zeropoint, to
be in good agreement with the mean values derived from other galaxies. In
combination with the best complementary sources of Cepheid calibration, we
reach 1.8% precision and find H_0=73.2 +/- 1.3 km/sec/Mpc, a 4.2 sigma
difference with the prediction from Planck CMB observations under LambdaCDM. We
expect to reach ~1.3% precision in the near term from an expanded sample of ~40
SNe Ia in Cepheid hosts.

          <p>Determining the distribution of redshifts of galaxies observed by wide-field
photometric experiments like the Dark Energy Survey is an essential component
to mapping the matter density field with gravitational lensing. In this work we
describe the methods used to assign individual weak lensing source galaxies
from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 Weak Lensing Source Catalogue to four
tomographic bins and to estimate the redshift distributions in these bins. As
the first application of these methods to data, we validate that the
assumptions made apply to the DES Y3 weak lensing source galaxies and develop a
full treatment of systematic uncertainties. Our method consists of combining
information from three independent likelihood functions: Self-Organizing Map
$p(z)$ (SOMPZ), a method for constraining redshifts from galaxy photometry;
clustering redshifts (WZ), constraints on redshifts from cross-correlations of
galaxy density functions; and shear ratios (SR), which provide constraints on
redshifts from the ratios of the galaxy-shear correlation functions at small
scales. Finally, we describe how these independent probes are combined to yield
an ensemble of redshift distributions encapsulating our full uncertainty. We
calibrate redshifts with combined effective uncertainties of $\sigma_{\langle z
\rangle}\sim 0.01$ on the mean redshift in each tomographic bin.

precision, large, realistic and robust simulations are required to calibrate

blending as survey depths increase. To capture the coupled effects of blending
in both shear and photometric redshift calibration, we define the effective
redshift distribution for lensing, $n_{\gamma}(z)$, and describe how to
estimate it using image simulations. We use an extensive suite of tailored
image simulations to characterize the performance of the shear estimation
pipeline applied to the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 dataset. We describe
the multi-band, multi-epoch simulations, and demonstrate their high level of
realism through comparisons to the real DES data. We isolate the effects that
generate shear calibration biases by running variations on our fiducial
simulation, and find that blending-related effects are the dominant
contribution to the mean multiplicative bias of approximately $-2\%$. By
generating simulations with input shear signals that vary with redshift, we
calibrate biases in our estimation of the effective redshfit distribution, and
demonstrate the importance of this approach when blending is present. We
provide corrected effective redshift distributions that incorporate statistical
and systematic uncertainties, ready for use in DES Year 3 weak lensing

2-point function analysis of the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES-Y3) dataset.
Using a variety of new ansatzes for covariance modelling and testing we
validate the assumptions and approximations of this model. These include the
assumption of a Gaussian likelihood, the trispectrum contribution to the
covariance, the impact of evaluating the model at a wrong set of parameters,
the impact of masking and survey geometry, deviations from Poissonian
shot-noise, galaxy weighting schemes and other, sub-dominant effects. We find
that our covariance model is robust and that its approximations have little
impact on goodness-of-fit and parameter estimation. The largest impact on
best-fit figure-of-merit arises from the so-called $f_{\mathrm{sky}}$
approximation for dealing with finite survey area, which on average increases
the $\chi^2$ between maximum posterior model and measurement by $3.7\%$
($\Delta \chi^2 \approx 18.9$). Standard methods to go beyond this
approximation fail for DES-Y3, but we derive an approximate scheme to deal with
these features. For parameter estimation, our ignorance of the exact parameters
at which to evaluate our covariance model causes the dominant effect. We find
that it increases the scatter of maximum posterior values for $\Omega_m$ and
$\sigma_8$ by about $3\%$ and for the dark energy equation of state parameter
by about $5\%$.

galaxies sample with redMaGiC galaxies (luminous red galaxies with secure
photometric redshifts) and a spectroscopic sample from BOSS/eBOSS to estimate
the redshift distribution of the DES sources sample. Two distinct methods for
using the clustering statistics are described. The first uses the clustering
information independently to estimate the mean redshift of the source galaxies
within a redshift window, as done in the DES Y1 analysis. The second method
establishes a likelihood of the clustering data as a function of $n(z)$, which
can be incorporated into schemes for generating samples of $n(z)$ subject to
combined clustering and photometric constraints. Both methods incorporate
marginalisation over various astrophysical systematics, including magnification
and redshift-dependent galaxy-matter bias. We characterise the uncertainties of
the methods in simulations; the first method recovers the mean $z$ of
tomographic bins to RMS (precision) of $\sim 0.014$. Use of the second method

simulations, a suite of 30 high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in
simulations based on the EAGLE code. We find that the majority of galaxies that
are quenched at $z=0$ ($\gtrsim$ 80$\%$) reached this state in a dense
environment (log$_{10}$M$_{200}$[M$_{\odot}$]$\geq$13.5). At low redshift,
regardless of the final cluster mass, galaxies appear to reach their quenching
state in low mass clusters. Moreover, galaxies quenched inside the cluster that
they reside in at $z=0$ are the dominant population in low-mass clusters, while
galaxies quenched in a different halo dominate in the most massive clusters.
When looking at clusters at $z&gt;0.5$, their in-situ quenched population
dominates at all cluster masses. This suggests that galaxies are quenched
inside the first cluster they fall into. After galaxies cross the cluster's
$r_{200}$ they rapidly become quenched ($\lesssim$ 1Gyr). Just a small fraction
of galaxies ($\lesssim 15\%$) is capable of retaining their gas for a longer
period of time, but after 4Gyr, almost all galaxies are quenched. This
phenomenon is related to ram pressure stripping and is produced when the
density of the intracluster medium reaches a threshold of $\rho_{\rm ICM}$
$\sim 3 \times 10 ^{-5}$ n$_{\rm H}$ (cm$^{-3}$). These results suggest that
galaxies start a rapid-quenching phase shortly after their first infall inside
$r_{200}$ and that, by the time they reach $r_{500}$, most of them are already
quenched.

the scatter in the stellar-to-halo mass relation of massive clusters. We derive
robust photometric stellar masses for a sample of brightest central galaxies

two equal-halo mass subsamples by their BCG stellar mass $M_*$. The weak
lensing profiles $\Delta\Sigma$ of the two cluster subsamples exhibit different
slopes on scales below 1 M$pc/h$. To interpret such discrepancy, we perform a
comprehensive Bayesian modelling of the two $\Delta\Sigma$ profiles by
including different levels of miscentring effects between the two subsamples as
informed by X-ray observations. We find that the two subsamples have the same
average halo mass of $1.74 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}/h$, but the concentration
of the low-$M_*$ clusters is $5.87_{-0.60}^{+0.77}$, ${\sim}1.5\sigma$ smaller
than that of their high-$M_*$ counterparts~($6.95_{-0.66}^{+0.78}$).
Furthermore, both cluster weak lensing and cluster-galaxy cross-correlations
indicate that the large-scale bias of the low-$M_*$, low-concentration clusters

systems, hence possible evidence of the cluster assembly bias effect. Our
results reveal a remarkable physical connection between the stellar mass within
20{-}30 k$pc/h$, the dark matter mass within ${\sim}$ 200 k$pc/h$, and the

(BGGs) in dynamically relaxed and unrelaxed galaxy groups for a sample of 154
galaxies in the SAMI galaxy survey. We characterize the dynamical state of the
groups using the luminosity gap between the two most luminous galaxies and the
BGG offset from the luminosity centroid of the group. We find that the
misalignment between the rotation axis of gas and stellar components is more
frequent in the BGGs in unrelaxed groups, although with quite low statistical
significance. Meanwhile galaxies whose stellar dynamics would be classified as
`regular rotators' based on their kinemetry are more common in relaxed groups.
We confirm that this dependency on group dynamical state remains valid at fixed
stellar mass and Sersic index. The observed trend could potentially originate
from a differing BGG accretion history in virialised and evolving groups.
Amongst the halo relaxation probes, the group BGG offset appears to play a
stronger role than the luminosity gap on the stellar kinematic differences of
the BGGs. However, both the group BGG offset and luminosity gap appear to
roughly equally drive the misalignment between the gas and stellar component of
the BGGs in one direction. This study offers the first evidence that the
dynamical state of galaxy groups may influence the BGG's stellar and gas
kinematics and calls for further studies using a larger sample with higher
signal-to-noise.

          <p>The pre-merging system of galaxy clusters Abell 3391-Abell 3395 located at a
mean redshift of 0.053 has been observed at 1 GHz in an ASKAP/EMU Early Science
observation as well as in X-rays with eROSITA. The projected separation of the
X-ray peaks of the two clusters is $\sim$50$'$ or $\sim$ 3.1 Mpc. Here we
present an inventory of interesting radio sources in this field around this
cluster merger. While the eROSITA observations provide clear indications of a
bridge of thermal gas between the clusters, neither ASKAP nor MWA observations
show any diffuse radio emission coinciding with the X-ray bridge. We derive an
upper limit on the radio emissivity in the bridge region of $\langle J
\rangle_{1\,{\rm GHz}}&lt; 1.2 \times 10^{-44} {\rm W}\, {\rm Hz}^{-1} {\rm
m}^{-3}$. A non-detection of diffuse radio emission in the X-ray bridge between
these two clusters has implications for particle-acceleration mechanisms in
cosmological large-scale structure. We also report extended or otherwise
noteworthy radio sources in the 30 deg$^2$ field around Abell 3391-Abell 3395.
We identified 20 Giant Radio Galaxies, plus 7 candidates, with linear projected
sizes greater than 1 Mpc. The sky density of field radio galaxies with largest
linear sizes of $&gt;0.7$ Mpc is $\approx 1.7$ deg$^{-2}$, three times higher than
previously reported. We find no evidence for a cosmological evolution of the
population of Giant Radio Galaxies. Moreover, we find seven candidates for
cluster radio relics and radio halos.

          <p>In this talk, we discuss the physics modelling of particle spectra arising
from dark matter (DM) annihilation or decay. In the context of the indirect
searches of DM, the final state products will, in general, undergo a set of
complicated processes such as resonance decays, QED/QCD radiation,
hadronisation and hadron decays. This set of processes lead to stable particles
(photons, positrons, anti-protons, and neutrinos among others) which travel for
very long distances before reaching the detectors. The modelling of their
spectra contains some uncertainties which are often neglected in the relevant
analyses. We discuss the sources of these uncertainties and estimate their
impact on photon energy spectra for benchmark DM scenarios with $m_\chi \in
[10, 1000]\,$GeV. Instructions for how to retrieve complete tables from Zenodo

          <p>We outline two important effects that are missing from most evaluations of
the dark matter capture rate in neutron stars. As dark matter scattering with
nucleons in the star involves large momentum transfer, nucleon structure must
be taken into account via a momentum dependence of the hadronic form factors.
In addition, due to the high density of neutron star matter, we should account
for nucleon interactions rather than modeling the nucleons as an ideal Fermi
gas. Properly incorporating these effects is found to suppress the dark matter
capture rate by up to three orders of magnitude.

it takes the form of a well-posed smooth convex optimization problem, solved

          <p>Line intensity mapping (LIM) provides a unique and powerful means to probe
cosmic structures by measuring the aggregate line emission from all galaxies
across redshift. The method is complementary to conventional galaxy redshift
surveys that are object-based and demand exquisite point-source sensitivity.
The Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME) will measure the star
formation rate (SFR) during cosmic reionization by observing the redshifted
[\ion{C}{ii}] 158$\mu$m line ($6 \lesssim z \lesssim 9$) in the LIM regime.
TIME will simultaneously study the abundance of molecular gas during the era of
peak star formation by observing the rotational CO lines emitted by galaxies at
$0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 2$. We present the modeling framework that predicts
the constraining power of TIME on a number of observables, including the line
luminosity function, and the auto- and cross-correlation power spectra,
including synergies with external galaxy tracers. Based on an optimized survey
strategy and fiducial model parameters informed by existing observations, we
forecast constraints on physical quantities relevant to reionization and galaxy
evolution, such as the escape fraction of ionizing photons during reionization,
the faint-end slope of the galaxy luminosity function at high redshift, and the
cosmic molecular gas density at cosmic noon. We discuss how these constraints
can advance our understanding of cosmological galaxy evolution at the two
distinct cosmic epochs for TIME, starting in 2021, and how they could be
improved in future phases of the experiment.

          <p>Recent estimations of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ based on gravitational waves
(GW) observations can be used to shed some light on the discrepancy between the
value of the Hubble parameter $H_0^P$ obtained from large scale observations
such as the Plank mission, and the small scale value $H_0^R$, obtained from low
redshift supernovae (SN). In order to investigate the origin of this
discrepancy we perform a combined analysis of the luminosity distance of SN and
GW sources and reconstruct the velocity and density field, using different SNs
catalogues. For the Union 2.1 catalogue we obtain evidence of a local
inhomogeneity with a density contrast $\delta_v=-0.462 \pm 0.031$, extending up
to a redshift of $z_v= 0.081\pm 0.007$, while for the Pantheon catalogue we
obtain $\delta_v=-0.106 \pm 0.026$ and $z_v = 0.055 \pm 0.003$. An
inhomogeneous model with $H_0^P$ is in general favored with respect to a
homogeneous model with $H_0^R$, but there is a significant difference between
the size and depth of the inhomogeneity obtained using the two datasets, which
could be due to some inconsistencies in the redshift correction applied to
Pantheon data, which is not publicly available as raw data without redshift
correction, contrary to Union 2.1.
</p>
<p>This shows the importance of making the raw data directly available to the
scientific community. The dominant monopole effect of this inhomogeneity on the
luminosity distance is proportional to the volume average of the density
contrast inside the sphere of radius equal to the distance of the source, which
is suppressed outside the inhomogeneity by the inverse cube of the distance. As
a direct consequence, since most of the GW sources are located outside this
inhomogeneity, they are only negligibly affected by it.

gravity with {\it gauged} scale symmetry: 1) the original Weyl quadratic
gravity and 2) the theory defined by a similar action but in the Palatini
approach obtained by replacing the Weyl connection by its Palatini counterpart.
These theories have different vectorial non-metricity induced by the gauge
field ($w_\mu$) of this symmetry. Both theories have a novel spontaneous
breaking of gauged scale symmetry, in the absence of matter, where the
necessary scalar field is not added ad-hoc to this purpose but is of geometric
origin and part of the quadratic action. The Einstein-Proca action (of
$w_\mu$), Planck scale and metricity emerge in the broken phase after $w_\mu$
acquires mass (Stueckelberg mechanism), then decouples. In the presence of
matter ($\phi_1$), non-minimally coupled, the scalar potential is similar in
both theories up to couplings and field rescaling. For small field values the
potential is Higgs-like while for large fields inflation is possible. Due to
their $R^2$ term, both theories have a small tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r\sim
10^{-3}$), larger in Palatini case. For a fixed spectral index $n_s$, reducing
the non-minimal coupling ($\xi_1$) increases $r$ which in Weyl theory is
bounded from above by that of Starobinsky inflation. For a small enough
$\xi_1\leq 10^{-3}$, unlike the Palatini version, Weyl theory gives a
dependence $r(n_s)$ similar to that in Starobinsky inflation, while also
protecting $r$ against higher dimensional operators corrections.

inflationary phase which ends with standard reheating, and thereby reduce the
high frequency part of the spectrum. An explicit model is constructed within
the cubic Horndeski theory which allows for stable violation of the NEC. We
present numerical examples of the background evolution having the different
maximal Hubble parameters (which determine the peak amplitude of gravitational
waves), the different inflationary Hubble parameters (which determine the
amplitudes of high frequency gravitational waves), and different durations of
the inflationary phase (which essentially determine the peak frequency of the
spectrum). We display the spectra with $n_t=0.8$, $0.9$, and $0.95$ for

          <p>Obtaining a better understanding of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is
crucial, as their properties could shed light on the origin and growth of their
supermassive counterparts. Massive star-forming clumps, which are present in a
large fraction of massive galaxies at $z \sim$ 1-3, are amongst the venues
wherein IMBHs could reside. We perform a series of Fokker-Planck simulations to
explore the occurrence of tidal disruption (TD) and gravitational wave (GW)
events about an IMBH in a massive star-forming clump, modelling the latter so
that its mass ($10^8 \,{\rm M}_{\odot}$) and effective radius ($100$ pc) are
consistent with the properties of both observed and simulated clumps. We find
that the TD and GW event rates are in the ranges $10^{-6}$-$10^{-5}$ and
$10^{-8}$-$10^{-7}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively, depending on the assumptions for
the initial inner density profile of the system ($\rho \propto r^{-2}$ or
$\propto r^{-1}$) and the initial mass of the central IMBH ($10^5$ or
$10^3\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$). By integrating the GW event rate over $z$ = 1-3, we
expect that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna will be able to detect
$\sim$2 GW events per yr coming from these massive clumps; the intrinsic rate
of TD events from these systems amounts instead to a few $10^3$ per yr, a
fraction of which will be observable by, e.g. the Square Kilometre Array and
the Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics. In conclusion, our results
support the idea that the forthcoming GW and electromagnetic facilities may
have the unprecedented opportunity of unveiling the lurking population of
IMBHs.

          <p>Axion miniclusters are dense bound structures of dark matter axions that are
predicted to form in the post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking
scenario. Although dense, miniclusters can easily be perturbed or even become
unbound by interactions with baryonic objects such as stars. Here, we
characterize the spatial distribution and properties of miniclusters in the
Milky Way (MW) today after undergoing these stellar interactions throughout
their lifetime. We do this by performing a suite of Monte Carlo simulations
which track the miniclusters' structure and, in particular, accounts for
partial disruption and mass loss through successive interactions. We consider
two density profiles - Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Power-law (PL) - for the
individual miniclusters in order to bracket the uncertainties on the
minicluster population today due to their uncertain formation history. For our
fiducial analysis at the Solar position, we find a survival probability of 99%
for miniclusters with PL profiles and 46% for those with NFW profiles. Our work
extends previous estimates of this local survival probability to the entire MW.
We find that towards the Galactic center, the survival probabilities drop
drastically. Although we present results for a particular initial halo mass
function, our simulations can be easily recast to different models using the
provided data and code. Finally, we comment on the impact of our results on
lensing, direct, and indirect detection.

        <strong>Transient Radio Signatures from Neutron Star Encounters with QCD Axion Miniclusters. (arXiv:2011.05378v2 [hep-ph] UPDATED)</strong>

          <p>The QCD axion is expected to form dense structures known as axion
miniclusters if the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is broken after inflation.
Miniclusters that have survived until today would interact with the population
of neutron stars (NSs) in the Milky Way to produce transient radio signals from
axion-photon conversion in the NS magnetosphere. Here, we quantify the rate,
duration, sky location, and brightness of these interactions for two different
minicluster internal density profiles. For both density profiles, we find that
these interactions: will occur frequently
($\mathcal{O}(1-100)\,\mathrm{day}^{-1}$); last between a day and a few months;
are spatially clustered towards the Galactic center; and can reach observable
fluxes. Searching for these transient signatures, which are within the reach of
current generation telescopes, therefore offers a promising pathway to
discovering QCD axion dark matter.

          <p>The question of whether Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and
polarization data from Planck favor a spatially closed Universe with curvature
parameter $\Omega_K&lt;0$ has been the subject of recent intense discussions.
Attempts to break the geometrical degeneracy combining Planck data with
external datasets such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements all
point towards a spatially flat Universe, at the cost of significant tensions
with Planck, which make the resulting dataset combination problematic. Settling
this issue requires identifying a dataset which can break the geometrical
degeneracy while not incurring in these tensions. We argue that cosmic
chronometers (CC), measurements of the expansion rate $H(z)$ from the relative
ages of massive early-type passively evolving galaxies, are the dataset we are
after. Furthermore, CC come with the additional advantage of being virtually
free of cosmological model assumptions. Combining Planck 2018 CMB temperature
and polarization data with the latest CC measurements, we break the geometrical
degeneracy and find $\Omega_K=-0.0054 \pm 0.0055$, consistent with a spatially
flat Universe and competitive with the Planck+BAO constraint. Our results are
stable against minimal parameter space extensions and CC systematics, and we
find no substantial tension between Planck and CC data within a non-flat
Universe, making the resulting combination reliable. Our results allow us to
assert with confidence that the Universe is spatially flat to the ${\cal
O}(10^{-2})$ level, a finding which might possibly settle the ongoing spatial
curvature debate, and lends even more support to the already very successful
inflationary paradigm.

          <p>The observed temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background can
be traced back to primordial curvature modes that are sourced by adiabatic
and/or entropic matter perturbations. In this paper, we explore the entropic
mechanism in the context of non-singular bouncing cosmologies. We show that
curvature modes are naturally generated during `graceful exit,' i.e., when the
smoothing slow contraction phase ends and the universe enters the bounce stage.
Here, the key role is played by the kinetic energy components that come to
dominate the energy density and drive the evolution towards the cosmological
bounce.
