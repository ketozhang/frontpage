          <p>We measure the size-mass relation and its evolution between redshifts
1$&lt;z&lt;$3, using galaxies lensed by six foreground Hubble Frontier Fields
clusters. The power afforded by strong gravitation lensing allows us to observe
galaxies with higher angular resolution beyond current facilities. We select a
stellar mass limited sample and divide them into star-forming or quiescent
classes based on their rest-frame UVJ colors from the ASTRODEEP catalogs.
Source reconstruction is carried out with the recently-released $lenstruction$
software. We derive the empirical relation between size and mass for the
late-type galaxies with $M_{*}&gt;3\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$ at 1$&lt;z&lt;$2.5 and $M_* &gt;5
\times 10^{9} M_{\odot}$ at 2.5$&lt;z&lt;$3, and at a fixed stellar mass, we find
galaxy sizes evolve as $R_{eff}\propto (1+z)^{-1.05\pm0.37}$. The intrinsic
scatter is $&lt;0.1$ dex at $z&lt;1.5$ but increases to $\sim0.3$ dex at higher
redshift. The results are in good agreement with those obtained in blank
fields. We evaluate the uncertainties associated with the choice of lens model
by comparing size measurements using five different and publicly available
models, finding the choice of lens model leads to a 3.7 % uncertainty of the
median value, and $\sim 25$ % scatter for individual galaxies. Our work
demonstrates the use of strong lensing magnification to boost resolution does
not introduce significant uncertainties in this kind of work, and paves the way
for wholesale applications of the sophisticated lens reconstruction technique
to higher redshifts and larger samples.

and Dark Matter studied in Ref. <a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1811.02302">arXiv:1811.02302</a>. The scenario is based on the
incomplete decay of the inflaton field into right-handed (s)neutrino pairs. By
imposing a discrete interchange symmetry on the inflaton and the right-handed
(s)neutrinos, one can ensure the stability of the inflaton field at the global
minimum today, while still allowing it to partially decay and reheat the
Universe after inflation. Compatibility of inflationary predictions, BBN bounds
and obtaining the right DM abundance for the inflaton Dark Matter candidate
typically requires large values of its coupling to the neutrino sector, and we
use supersymmetry to protect the inflaton from potentially dangerous large
radiative corrections which may spoil the required flatness of its potential.
In addition, the inflaton will decay now predominatly into sneutrinos during
reheating, which in turn give rise both to the thermal bath made of Standard
Model particles, and inflaton particles. We have performed a through analyses
of the reheating process following the evolution of all the partners involved,
identifying the different regimes in the parameter space for the final Dark
Matter candidate. This as usual can be a WIMP-like inflaton particle or an
oscillating condensate, but we find a novel regime for a FIMP-like candidate.

scalar field, nonminimally coupled to gravity, drives inflation and
simultaneously generates the baryon asymmetry of universe via Affleck-Dine

Affleck-Dine inflation in the use of two chiral superfields with appropriate

          <p>The unprecedented amount and the excellent quality of lensing data that the
upcoming ground- and space-based surveys will produce represent a great
opportunity to shed light on the questions that still remain unanswered
concerning our universe and the validity of the standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological model. Therefore, it is important to develop new techniques that
can exploit the huge quantity of data that future observations will give us
access to in the most effective way possible. For this reason, we decided to
investigate the development of a new method to treat weak lensing higher order
statistics, which are known to break degeneracy among cosmological parameters
thanks to their capability of probing the non-Gaussian properties of the shear
field. In particular, the proposed method directly applies to the observed
quantity, i.e., the noisy galaxy ellipticity. We produced simulated lensing
maps with different sets of cosmological parameters and used them to measure
higher order moments, Minkowski functionals, Betti numbers, and other
statistics related to graph theory. This allowed us to construct datasets with
different size, precision, and smoothing. We then applied several machine
learning algorithms to determine which method best predicts the actual
cosmological parameters associated with each simulation. The best model
resulted to be simple multidimensional linear regression. We used this model to
compare the results coming from the different datasets and found out that we
can measure with good accuracy the majority of the parameters that we
considered. We also investigated the relation between each higher order
estimator and the different cosmological parameters for several signal-to-noise
thresholds and redshifts bins. Given the promising results, we consider this
approach as a valuable resource, worth of further development.

chromatic ionospheric effects on global 21-cm observations. From the analyses,
we found that the magnitude of the ionospheric disruptions due to ionospheric
refraction and absorption can be greater than the expected global 21-cm signal,
and the variation of its magnitude can differ, depending on the ionospheric
conditions. Within the parameter space adopted in the model, the shape of the
global 21-cm signal is distorted after propagating through the ionosphere,
while its amplitude is weakened. It is observed that the ionospheric effects do
not cancel out over time, and thus should be accounted for in the foreground

          <p>The 21 cm intensity mapping experiments promise to obtain the large-scale
distribution of HI gas at the post-reionization epoch. In order to reveal the
underlying matter density fluctuations from the HI mapping, it is important to
understand how HI gas traces the matter density distribution. Both nonlinear
halo clustering and nonlinear effects modulating HI gas in halos may determine
the scale below which the HI bias deviates from linearity. We employ three
approaches to generate the mock HI density from a large-scale N-body simulation
at low redshifts, and demonstrate that the assumption of HI linearity is valid
at the scale corresponding to the first peak of baryon acoustic oscillations,
but breaks down at $k \gtrsim 0.1\,h\, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. The nonlinear effects
of halo clustering and HI content modulation counteract each other at small
scales, and their competition results in a model-dependent "sweet-spot"
redshift near $z$=1 where the HI bias is scale-independent down to small
scales. We also find that the linear HI bias scales approximately linearly with
redshift for $z\le 3$.

machine learning methods to investigate any possible deviations from
$\Lambda$CDM at both low and high redshifts by using the latest cosmological

dark energy (DE) in a model independent fashion by reconstructing its equation
of state $w(z)$, the growth index of matter density perturbations $\gamma(z)$,
the linear DE anisotropic stress $\eta_\textrm{DE}(z)$ and the adiabatic sound
speed $c_\textrm{s,DE}^2(z)$ of DE perturbations. We find a $\sim2\sigma$
deviation of $w(z)$ from -1 at high redshifts, the adiabatic sound speed is
negative at the $\sim2.5\sigma$ level at $z=0.1$ and a $\sim2\sigma$ deviation
of the anisotropic stress from unity at low redshifts and $\sim4 \sigma$ at

In this paper, we investigate the stability of non-isothermal fermionic dark
matter halos. We show that in the presence of temperature gradient, the force
due to the pressure has both inward and outward components. In some regions of
halos, the inward force that provides stability is due to the pressure rather
than gravity. Moreover, it is shown that higher temperature gradients lead to
halos with lower mass and size. We prove that if the temperature is left as a
free positive profile, one can place no phase-space lower bound on the mass of
dark matter. For halos that are in the low degeneracy classic domain, we derive
an analytic expression of their temperature in terms of their mass density and
place an upper bound on the mass of dark matter by requiring that temperature
is not negative. We then use the Burkert mass profile for the Milky Way to show
that if the central temperature of the halo is a few Kelvins, the mass of dark
matter cannot exceed a few keV.

supernovae compilation and lastly, measurements of Redshift Space Distortions

the nonadiabatic pressure perturbation is consistent with zero within
$1\sigma$. Finally, we also present a new, publicly available, RSD likelihood
for MontePython based on the "Gold 2018" growth rate data compilation.

          <p>Very recently, the Xenon1T collaboration has reported an intriguing electron
recoil excess, which may imply for light dark matter. In order to interpret
this anomaly, we propose the atmospheric dark matter (ADM) from the inelastic
collision of cosmic rays (CRs) with the atmosphere. Due to the boost effect of
high energy CRs, we show that the light ADM can be fast-moving and successfully
fit the observed electron recoil spectrum through the ADM-electron scattering
process. Meanwhile, our ADM predicts the scattering cross section $\sigma_e
\sim {\cal O}(10^{-38}- 10^{-39}$) cm$^{2}$, and thus can evade other direct
detection constraints. The search for light meson rare decays, such as $\eta
\to \pi + \slashed E_T$, would provide a complementary probe of our ADM in the
future.

          <p>We extend our previous analysis of a model for "dark energy" based on a Weyl
scaling invariant dark energy action. We reexpress all prior results in terms
of proper time, and derive a compact formula for the squared effective Hubble
parameter in the model. This formula involves effective dark energy and matter
densities that differ from their expressions in the standard $\Lambda CDM$
cosmology, and are illustrated by sample numerical results. We also give new

          <p>We use an information theoretic framework to analyze data from the Galaxy Zoo
2 project and study if there are any statistically significant correlations
between the presence of bars in spiral galaxies and their environment. We
measure the mutual information between the barredness of galaxies and their
environments in a volume limited sample ($M_r \leq -21$) and compare it with
the same in datasets where (i) the bar/unbar classifications are randomized and
(ii) the spatial distribution of galaxies are shuffled on different length
scales. We assess the statistical significance of the differences in the mutual
information using a t-test and find that both randomization of morphological
classifications and shuffling of spatial distribution do not alter the mutual
information in a statistically significant way. The non-zero mutual information
between barredness and environment arises due to the finite and discrete nature
of the dataset which can be entirely explained by mock Poisson distributions.
We also separately compare the cumulative distribution functions of the barred
and unbarred galaxies as a function of their local density. Using a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we find that the null hypothesis can not be rejected
even at $75\%$ confidence level. Our analysis indicates that environments do
not play a significant role in the formation of a bar, which is largely
determined by the internal processes of the host galaxy.

          <p>Cosmological simulations predict that galaxies are embedded into triaxial
dark matter haloes, which appear approximately elliptical in projection. Weak
gravitational lensing allows us to constrain these halo shapes and thereby test
the nature of dark matter. Weak lensing has already provided robust detections
of the signature of halo flattening at the mass scales of groups and clusters,
whereas results for galaxies have been somewhat inconclusive. Here we combine
data from five surveys (NGVSLenS, KiDS/KV450, CFHTLenS, CS82, and RCSLenS) in
order to tighten observational constraints on galaxy-scale halo ellipticity for
photometrically selected lens samples. We constrain $f_\rm{h}$, the average
ratio between the aligned component of the halo ellipticity and the ellipticity
of the light distribution, finding $f_\rm{h}=0.303^{+0.080}_{-0.079}$ for red
lenses and $f_\rm{h}=0.217^{+0.160}_{-0.159}$ for blue lenses when assuming
elliptical NFW density profiles and a linear scaling between halo ellipticity
and galaxy ellipticity. Our constraints for red galaxies constitute the
currently most significant ($3.8\sigma$) systematics-corrected detection of the
signature of halo flattening at the mass scale of galaxies. Our results are in
good agreement with expectations from the Millennium Simulation that apply the
same analysis scheme and incorporate models for galaxy-halo misalignment.
Assuming these misalignment models and the analysis assumptions stated above
are correct, our measurements imply an average dark matter halo ellipticity for
the studied red galaxy samples of $\langle|\epsilon_\rm{h}|\rangle=0.174\pm
0.046$, where $|\epsilon_{h}|=(1-q)/(1+q)$ relates to the ratio $q=b/a$ of the
minor and major axes of the projected mass distribution. Similar measurements
based on larger upcoming weak lensing data sets can help to calibrate models
for intrinsic galaxy alignments. [abridged]

          <p>We present a novel application of partial convolutional neural networks
(PCNN) that can inpaint masked images of the cosmic microwave background. The
network can reconstruct both the maps and the power spectra to a few percent
for circular and irregularly shaped masks covering up to ~10% of the image
area. By performing a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test we show that the reconstructed
maps and power spectra are indistinguishable from the input maps and power
spectra at the 99.9% level. Moreover, we show that PCNNs can inpaint maps with
regular and irregular masks to the same accuracy. This should be particularly
beneficial to inpaint irregular masks for the CMB that come from astrophysical
sources such as galactic foregrounds. The proof of concept application shown in
this paper shows that PCNNs can be an important tool in data analysis pipelines
in cosmology.

          <p>Hubble tension is routinely presented as a mismatch between the Hubble
constant H_0 determined locally and a value inferred from the flat LCDM
cosmology. In essence, the tension boils down to a disagreement between two
numbers. Here, assuming the tension is cosmological in origin, we predict that
within flat LCDM there should be other inferred values of H_0, and that a
"running of H_0 with redshift" can be expected. These additional determinations
of H_0 may be traced to a difference between the effective equation of state
(EoS) of the Universe and the current standard model. We introduce a diagnostic
that flags such a running of H_0.

          <p>It is investigated the cosmological dynamics of scalar-torsion $f(T,\phi)$
gravity as a dark energy model. We concerned about the phenomenology of model
$f(T,\phi)=-T/2 \kappa^2-F(\phi) G(T)-V(\phi)$, with $F(\phi)\sim e^{-\sigma
\kappa\phi}$, $V(\phi)\sim e^{-\lambda \kappa\phi}$ and $G(T)\sim T^{1+s}$. We
obtain the critical points of the autonomous system, along with the stability
conditions of each one of them and their cosmological properties. Particularly,
we show the existence of new attractors with accelerated expansion, as well as,
new scaling solutions in which the energy density of dark energy scales as the
background fluid density, thus, defining the so-called scaling radiation and
scaling matter epochs. The scaling solutions are saddle points, and therefore,
the system exits these solutions to the current epoch of cosmic acceleration,
toward attractors points describing the dark energy dominated era.
