          <p>We present a cosmological analysis of abundances and stacked weak-lensing
profiles of galaxy clusters, exploiting the AMICO KiDS-DR3 catalogue. The
sample consists of 3652 galaxy clusters with intrinsic richness
$\lambda^*\geq20$, over an effective area of 377 deg$^2$, in the redshift range
$z\in[0.1,\,0.6]$. We quantified the purity and completeness of the sample
through simulations. The statistical analysis has been performed by
simultaneously modelling the comoving number density of galaxy clusters and the
scaling relation between the intrinsic richnesses and the cluster masses,
assessed through a stacked weak-lensing profile modelling. The fluctuations of
the matter background density, caused by super-survey modes, have been taken
into account in the likelihood. Assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we
constrained $\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\sigma_8$, $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm
m}/0.3)^{0.5}$, and the parameters of the mass-richness scaling relation. We
obtained $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.24^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$,
$\sigma_8=0.89^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$, $S_8=0.80^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$. The constraint on
$S_8$ is consistent within 1$\sigma$ with the results from WMAP and Planck.
Furthermore, we got constraints on the cluster mass scaling relation in
agreement with those obtained from a previous weak-lensing only analysis.

          <p>We investigate the morphology of the stellar halo (SH) in a sample of Milky
Way (MW) like galaxies in the TNG50 simulation. Using a local in shell
iterative method (LSIM) as the main approach, we explicitly show evidence of
twisting (in about 52% of halos) and stretching (in 48% of them) in the real
space. This is matched with the re-orientation observed in the eigenvectors of
the inertia tensor and gives us a clear picture of having a re-oriented SH. We
make a comparison between the shape profile of dark matter (DM) halo and SH and
quite remarkably see that their radial profiles are fairly close, especially at
small galactocentric radii where the stellar disk is located. This implies that
the DM halo is somewhat aligned with the stellar disk in response to the
baryonic potential. The level of alignment mostly decreases away from the
center. We study the impact of substructures in the orbital circularity
parameter. It is demonstrated that in some halos far away substructures are
counter-rotating compared with the central stars and may flip the sign of total
angular momentum and thus the orbital circularity parameter. Truncating them
above 150 kpc, however, retains the disky structure of the galaxy as per
initial selection. Including the impact of substructures in the shape of SH, we
explicitly show that their contribution is subdominant. Overlaying our
theoretical results to the observational constraints from previous literature,
we establish a fair agreement.

          <p>Galaxy models predict a tight relation between the clustering of galaxies and
dark matter on cosmological scales, but predictions differ notably in the
details. We used this opportunity and tested two semi-analytic models by the
Munich and Durham groups with data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope
Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). For the test we measured the scale-dependent galaxy
bias factor $b(k)$ and correlation factor $r(k)$ from linear to non-linear
scales of $k\approx10\,h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$ at two redshifts $\bar{z}=0.35,0.51$
for galaxies with stellar mass between $5\times10^9$ and
$3\times10^{11}\,h_{\rm 70}^{-2}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Our improved gravitational
lensing technique accounts for the intrinsic alignment of sources and the
magnification of lens galaxies for better constraints for the galaxy-matter
correlation $r(k)$. Galaxy bias in CFHTLenS increases with $k$ and stellar
mass, it is colour-dependent, revealing the individual footprints of galaxy
types. Despite a reasonable model agreement for the relative change with both
scale and galaxy properties, there is a clear conflict for $b(k)$ with no model
preference: the model galaxies are too weakly clustered. This may flag a model
problem at $z\gtrsim0.3$ for all stellar masses. As in the models, however,
there is a high correlation $r(k)$ between matter and galaxy density on all
scales, and galaxy bias is typically consistent with a deterministic bias on
linear scales. Only our blue and low-mass galaxies of about
$7\times10^9\,h_{\rm 70}^{-2}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ at $\bar{z}=0.51$ show, contrary
to the models, a weak tendency towards a stochastic bias on linear scales where
$r_{\rm ls}=0.75\pm0.14\,{\rm(stat.)}\pm0.06\,{\rm(sys.)}$. This result is of
interest for cosmological probes, such as $E_{\rm G}$, that rely on a
deterministic galaxy bias.

          <p>Next-generation surveys like the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) on
the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will generate orders of magnitude more
discoveries of transients and variable stars than previous surveys. To prepare
for this data deluge, we developed the Photometric LSST Astronomical
Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC), a competition which aimed to
catalyze the development of robust classifiers under LSST-like conditions of a
non-representative training set for a large photometric test set of imbalanced
classes. Over 1,000 teams participated in PLAsTiCC, which was hosted in the
Kaggle data science competition platform between Sep 28, 2018 and Dec 17, 2018,
ultimately identifying three winners in February 2019. Participants produced
classifiers employing a diverse set of machine learning techniques including
hybrid combinations and ensemble averages of a range of approaches, among them
boosted decision trees, neural networks, and multi-layer perceptrons. The
strong performance of the top three classifiers on Type Ia supernovae and
kilonovae represent a major improvement over the current state-of-the-art
within astronomy. This paper summarizes the most promising methods and
evaluates their results in detail, highlighting future directions both for
classifier development and simulation needs for a next generation PLAsTiCC data

is sensitive both to the neutrino magnetic moment and the structure of the

          <p>The primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) produced in the early universe are
expected to be the origin of the large-scale cosmic magnetic fields. The PMFs
are considered to leave a footprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
anisotropies due to both the electromagnetic force and gravitational
interaction. In this paper, we investigate how the PMFs affect the CMB
anisotropies on smaller scales than the mean-free-path of the CMB photons. We
solve the baryon Euler equation with Lorentz force due to the PMFs, and we show
that the vector-type perturbations from the PMFs induce the CMB anisotropies
below the Silk scale as $\ell&gt;3000$. Based on our calculations, we put a
constraint on the PMFs from the combined CMB temperature anisotropies obtained
by Planck and South Pole Telescope (SPT). We have found that the
highly-resolved temperature anisotropies of the SPT 2017 bandpowers at $\ell
\lesssim 8000$ favor the PMF model with a small scale-dependence. As a result,
the Planck and SPT's joint-analysis puts a constraint on the PMF spectral index
as $n_B&lt;-1.14$ at 95% confidence level (C.L.), and this is more stringent
compared with the Planck-only constraint $n_B&lt;-0.28$. We show that the PMF
strength normalized on the co-moving 1 Mpc scale is also tightly constrained as
$B_{1\mathrm{Mpc}}&lt;1.5$ nG with Planck and SPT at 95% C.L., while
$B_{1\mathrm{Mpc}}&lt;3.2$ nG only with the Planck data at 95% C.L. We also
discuss the effects on the cosmological parameter estimate when including the
SPT data and CMB anisotropies induced by the PMFs.

prior on the population of objects observed in the DES and their moments in
light distribution, a source of high-quality redshift information in

and a host of deep extragalactic science. Numbering $2.8~$million objects
($1.6~$million post masking), our catalogue is drawn from images coadded to
consistent depths of $r=25.7, i=25, z=24.3$ mag. We use a new model-fitting

          <p>We describe an updated calibration and diagnostic framework, Balrog, used to
directly sample the selection and photometric biases of Dark Energy Survey's
(DES) Year 3 (Y3) dataset. We systematically inject onto the single-epoch
images of a random 20% subset of the DES footprint an ensemble of nearly 30
million realistic galaxy models derived from DES Deep Field observations. These
augmented images are analyzed in parallel with the original data to
automatically inherit measurement systematics that are often too difficult to
capture with traditional generative models. The resulting object catalog is a
Monte Carlo sampling of the DES transfer function and is used as a powerful
diagnostic and calibration tool for a variety of DES Y3 science, particularly
for the calibration of the photometric redshifts of distant "source" galaxies
and magnification biases of nearer "lens" galaxies. The recovered Balrog
injections are shown to closely match the photometric property distributions of
the Y3 GOLD catalog, particularly in color, and capture the number density
fluctuations from observing conditions of the real data within 1% for a typical
galaxy sample. We find that Y3 colors are extremely well calibrated, typically
within ~1-8 millimagnitudes, but for a small subset of objects we detect
significant magnitude biases correlated with large overestimates of the
injected object size due to proximity effects and blending. We discuss
approaches to extend the current methodology to capture more aspects of the
transfer function and reach full coverage of the survey footprint for future
analyses.

sample galaxies to be used in weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering
studies. To perform this measurement, we cross-correlate with spectroscopic
galaxies from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Survey (BOSS) and its extension,
eBOSS. We validate our methodology in simulations, including a new technique to
calibrate systematic errors due to the galaxy clustering bias, finding our
method to be generally unbiased in calibrating the mean redshift. We apply our
method to the data, and estimate the redshift distribution for eleven different
photometrically-selected bins. We find general agreement between clustering
redshift and photometric redshift estimates, with differences on the inferred
mean redshift to be below $|\Delta z|=0.01$ in most of the bins. We also test a
method to calibrate a width parameter for redshift distributions, which we
found necessary to use for some of our samples. Our typical uncertainties on
the mean redshift ranged from 0.003 to 0.008, while our uncertainties on the
width ranged from 4 to 9\%. We discuss how these results calibrate the

          <p>Binary neutron star mergers offer a new and independent means of measuring
the Hubble constant $H_0$ by combining the gravitational-wave inferred source
luminosity distance with its redshift obtained from electromagnetic follow-up.
This method is limited by intrinsic degeneracy between the system distance and
orbital inclination in the gravitational-wave signal. Observing the afterglow
counterpart to a merger can further constrain the inclination angle, allowing
this degeneracy to be partially lifted and improving the measurement of $H_0$.
In the case of the binary neutron star merger GW170817, afterglow light-curve
and imagery modeling thus allowed to improve the $H_0$ measurement by a factor
of 3. However, systematic access to afterglow data is far from guaranteed. In
fact, though each one allows a leap in $H_0$ precision, these afterglow
counterparts should prove rare in forthcoming multimessenger campaigns. We
combine models for emission and detection of gravitational-wave and
electromagnetic radiation from binary neutron star mergers with realistic
population models and estimates for afterglow inclination angle constraints.
Using these models, we quantify how fast $H_0$ will be narrowed-down by
successive multimessenger events with and without the afterglow. We find that,
because of its rareness and though it greatly refines angle estimates, the
afterglow counterpart should not significantly contribute to the measurement of
$H_0$ in the long run.

          <p>Gravitational waves (GWs) are subject to gravitational lensing in the same
way as electromagnetic radiation. However, to date, no unequivocal observation
of a lensed GW transient has been reported. Independently, GW observatories
continue to search for the stochastic GW signal which is produced by many
transient events at high redshift. We exploit a surprising connection between
the lensing of individual transients and limits to the background radiation
produced by the unresolved population of binary back hole mergers: we show that
it constrains the fraction of individually resolvable lensed binary black holes
to less than $\sim 4\times 10^{-5}$ at present sensitivity. We clarify the
interpretation of existing, low redshift GW observations (obtained assuming no
lensing) in terms of their apparent lensed redshifts and masses and explore
constraints from GW observatories at future sensitivity. Based on our results,
recent claims of observations of lensed events are statistically disfavoured.

          <p>The classification of dark matter halos as isolated hosts or subhalos is
critical for our understanding of structure formation and the galaxy-halo
connection. Most commonly, subhalos are defined to reside inside a spherical
overdensity boundary such as the virial radius. The resulting host-subhalo
relations depend sensitively on the somewhat arbitrary overdensity threshold,
but the impact of this dependence is rarely quantified. The recently proposed
splashback radius tends to be larger and to include more subhalos than even the
largest spherical overdensity boundaries. We systematically investigate the
dependence of the subhalo fraction on the radius definition and show that it
can vary by factors of unity between different spherical overdensity
definitions. Using splashback radii can yet double the abundance of subhalos
compared to the virial definition. We also quantify the abundance of flyby (or
backsplash) halos, hosts that used to be subhalos in the past. We show that the
majority of these objects are mislabeled satellites that are naturally
classified as subhalos when we use the splashback radius. We show that the
subhalo fraction can be understood as a universal function of only peak height
and the slope of the linear power spectrum. We provide a simple fitting
function that captures our simulation results to 20% accuracy across a wide
range of halo masses, redshifts, and cosmologies. Finally, we demonstrate that
splashback radii significantly change our understanding of satellite and flyby
galaxies in the local group.

galaxies by foreground galaxies through the analysis of the cross-correlation
function was recently demonstrated as an interesting independent alternative to
the weak-lensing shear as a cosmological probe. In the case of the proposed
observable, most of the cosmological constraints mainly depend on the largest
angular separation measurements. Therefore, we aim to study and correct the
main large-scale biases that affect foreground and background galaxy samples to
produce a robust estimation of the cross-correlation function. Then we analyse
the corrected signal to derive updated cosmological constraintsWe measured the
large-scale, bias-corrected cross-correlation functions using a background
sample of H-ATLAS galaxies with photometric redshifts &gt; 1.2 and two different
foreground samples (GAMA galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts or SDSS galaxies
with photometric ones, both in the range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.8). These measurements are
modelled using the traditional halo model description that depends on both halo
occupation distribution and cosmological parameters. We then estimated these
parameters by performing a Markov chain Monte Carlo under multiple scenarios to
study the performance of this observable and how to improve its results. After
the large-scale bias corrections, we obtain only minor improvements with
respect to the previous magnification bias results, mainly confirming their
conclusions: a lower bound on $\Omega_m &gt; 0.22$ at $95\%$ C.L. and an upper
bound $\sigma_8 &lt; 0.97$ at $95\%$ C.L. (results from the $z_{spec}$ sample).
However, by combining both foreground samples into a simplified tomographic
analysis, we were able to obtain interesting constraints on the
$\Omega_m$-$\sigma_8$ plane as follows: $\Omega_m= 0.50_{- 0.20}^{+ 0.14}$ and
$\sigma_8= 0.75_{- 0.10}^{+ 0.07}$ at 68\% CL.

          <p>The one-point probability distribution function (PDF) is a powerful summary
statistic for non-Gaussian cosmological fields, such as the weak lensing (WL)
convergence reconstructed from galaxy shapes or cosmic microwave background
(CMB) maps. Thus far, no analytic model has been developed that successfully
describes the high-convergence tail of the WL convergence PDF for small
smoothing scales from first principles. Here, we present a halo-model formalism
to compute the WL convergence PDF, building upon our previous results for the
thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich field. Furthermore, we extend our formalism to
analytically compute the covariance matrix of the convergence PDF. Comparisons
to numerical simulations generally confirm the validity of our formalism in the
non-Gaussian, positive tail of the WL convergence PDF, but also reveal the
convergence PDF's strong sensitivity to small-scale systematic effects in the
simulations (e.g., due to finite resolution). Finally, we present a simple
Fisher forecast for a Rubin-Observatory-like survey, based on our new analytic
model. Considering the $\{A_s, \Omega_m, \Sigma m_\nu\}$ parameter space and
assuming a Planck CMB prior on $A_s$ only, we forecast a marginalized
constraint $\sigma(\Sigma m_\nu) \approx 0.08$ eV from the WL convergence PDF
alone, even after marginalizing over parameters describing the halo
concentration-mass relation. This error bar on the neutrino mass sum is
comparable to the minimum value allowed in the normal hierarchy, illustrating
the strong constraining power of the WL convergence PDF. We make our code

          <p>Line intensity mapping (LIM) is a promising observational method to probe
large-scale fluctuations of line emission from distant galaxies. Data from
wide-field LIM observations allow us to study the large-scale structure of the
universe as well as galaxy populations and their evolution. A serious problem
with LIM is contamination by foreground/background sources and various noise
contributions. We develop conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs)
that extract designated signals and information from noisy maps. We train the
cGANs using 30,000 mock observation maps with assuming a Gaussian noise matched
to the expected noise level of NASA's SPHEREx mission. The trained cGANs
successfully reconstruct H{\alpha} emission from galaxies at a target redshift
from observed, noisy intensity maps. Intensity peaks with heights greater than
3.5 {\sigma} noise are located with 60 % precision. The one-point probability
distribution and the power spectrum are accurately recovered even in the
noise-dominated regime. However, the overall reconstruction performance depends
on the pixel size and on the survey volume assumed for the training data. It is
necessary to generate training mock data with a sufficiently large volume in
order to reconstruct the intensity power spectrum at large angular scales. Our
deep-learning approach can be readily applied to observational data with line
confusion and with noise.

          <p>We use the gravitational wave (GW) events GW170817 and GW190521, together
with their proposed electromagnetic counterparts, to constrain cosmological
parameters and theories of gravity beyond General Relativity (GR). In
particular we consider models with a time-varying Planck mass, large
extra-dimensions, and a phenomenological parametrization covering several
beyond-GR theories. In all three cases, this introduces a friction term into
the GW propagation equation, effectively modifying the GW luminosity distance.
We set constraints on $\Lambda$CDM parameters and GR deviation parameters using
two sets of priors on the Hubble constant and matter energy density. With
priors set to the measured Planck's mission values, we find that with the
inclusion of GW190521, the two GR deviation parameters constraints improves by
a factor $\sim 10$, we report a number of spacetime dimensions compatible with
$4$ with an precision of $2.5\%$ (at 95\% CL) and an upper limit to the
variation of Netwon's constant at the epoch of GW170817 $&lt;20\%$. With wide
priors on the Hubble constant and matter energy density, we show that it is
still possible to constrain the $\Lambda$CDM parameters and GR deviation
parameters conjointly from GW170817 and GW190521 obtaining constraints on GR
deviation parameters which are a factor $2-6$ worse than the results using
restricted priors on $\Lambda$CDM parameters.

          <p>The past lightcone of an observer in a cosmological spacetime is the unique
geometric structure directly linked to observations. After general properties
of the Hawking energy along slices of the past lightcone were studied in
<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2003.13583">arXiv:2003.13583</a>, the present work continues along this path by providing
explicit cosmological applications of the Hawking energy associated with a
lightcone. Firstly, it is shown that amongst all two-dimensional non-trapped
spheres with equal area and average matter density, a shear-free matter
maximizes the Hawking energy for sufficiently high densities. Secondly, a
Robertson-Walker reference slice is constructed for every lightcone slice based
on area and energy. Thirdly, the implications of the monotonicity of the energy
down the lightcone are explored, arriving at two new bounds on the cosmic
fluid's density and equation-of-state parameter.

          <p>We propose a decaying cold dark matter model to explain the excess of
electron recoil observed at the XENON1T experiment. In this scenario, the
daughter dark matter from the parent dark matter decay easily obtains velocity
large enough to saturate the peak of the electron recoil energy around 2.5 keV,
and the observed signal rate can be fulfilled by the parent dark matter with a
mass of order 10-200 MeV and a lifetime larger than the age of Universe. We
verify that this model is consistent with experimental limits from dark matter
detections, Cosmic Microwave Background and Large Scale Structure experiments.

          <p>We consider light dark matter candidates originated from the evaporation of
Schwarzschild primordial black holes, with masses in the range $10^{-5}-10^9$
g. These candidates are beyond Standard Model particles with negligible
couplings to the other particles, so that they interact only gravitationally.
Belonging to the category of warm dark matter, they nevertheless spoil
structure formation, with a softer impact for increasing values of the
candidate spin. Requiring such candidates to fully account for the observed
dark matter, we find that the scenario of black hole domination is ruled out
for all spin values up to 2. For the scenario of radiation domination, we
derive upper limits on the parameter $\beta$ (the primordial black hole energy
density at formation over the radiation one), which are less stringent the
higher the candidate spin is.
