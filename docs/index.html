          <p>Tidally dissolved globular clusters form thin stellar streams that preserve a
historical record of their past evolution. We report a radial velocity
dispersion of $2.3\pm0.3\,\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}$ in the GD-1 stellar
stream using a sample of 43 spectroscopically confirmed members. The GD-1
velocity dispersion is constant over the surveyed $\approx15^\circ$ span of the
stream. We also measured velocity dispersion in the spur adjacent to the main
GD-1 stream, and found a similar value at the tip of the spur. Surprisingly,
the region of the spur closer to the stream appears dynamically colder than the
main stream. An unperturbed model of the GD-1 stream has a velocity dispersion
of $\approx0.6\,\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}$, indicating that GD-1 has
undergone dynamical heating. Stellar streams arising from globular clusters,
which prior to their arrival in the Milky Way, orbited a dwarf galaxy with a
cored density profile are expected to have experienced the amount of heating
required to match the velocity dispersion observed in GD-1. This suggests that
GD-1 has been accreted and that imprints of its original host galaxy, including
the inner slope of its dark-matter halo, remain observable in the stream today.

          <p>The recent advent of deep observational surveys of local Milky Way
`analogues' and their satellite populations allows us to place the Milky Way in
a broader cosmological context and to test models of galaxy formation on small
scales. In the present study, we use the LCDM-based ARTEMIS suite of
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations containing 45 Milky Way analogue host
haloes to make comparisons to the observed satellite luminosity functions,
radial distribution functions, and abundance scaling relations from the recent
Local Volume and SAGA observational surveys, in addition to the Milky Way and
M31. We find that, contrary to some previous claims, LCDM-based simulations can
successfully and simultaneously capture the mean trends and the diversity in
both the observed luminosity and radial distribution functions of Milky Way
analogues once important observational selection criteria are factored in.
Furthermore, we show that, at fixed halo mass, the concentration of the
simulated satellite radial distribution is partly set by that of the underlying
smooth dark matter halo, although stochasticity due to the finite number of
satellites is the dominant driver of scatter in the radial distribution of
satellites at fixed halo mass.

          <p>Chain Inflation is an alternative to slow roll inflation in which the
universe undergoes a series of transitions between different vacua. The density
perturbations (studied in this paper) are seeded by the probabilistic nature of
tunneling rather than quantum fluctuations of the inflaton. We find the scalar
power spectrum of chain inflation and show that it is fully consistent with a
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In agreement with some of the previous literature (and
disagreement with others), we show that $10^4$ phase transitions per e-fold are
required in order to agree with the amplitude of Cosmic Microwave Background
anisotropies within the observed range of scales. Interestingly, the amplitude
of perturbations constrains chain inflation to a regime of highly unstable de
Sitter spaces, which may be favorable from a quantum gravity perspective since
the Swampland Conjecture on Trans-Planckian Censorship is automatically
satisfied. We provide new analytic estimates for the bounce action and the
tunneling rate in periodic potentials which replace the thin-wall approximation
in the regime of fast tunneling. Finally, we study model implications and
derive an upper limit of $\sim 10^{10}$ GeV on the axion decay constant in
viable chain inflation with axions.

          <p>The non-spherical shapes of dark matter and gas distributions introduce
systematic uncertainties that affect observable-mass relations and selection
functions of galaxy groups and clusters. However, the triaxial gas
distributions depend on the non-linear physical processes of halo formation
histories and baryonic physics, which are challenging to model accurately. In
this study we explore a machine learning approach for modelling the dependence
of gas shapes on dark matter and baryonic properties. With data from the
Illustris-TNG hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, we develop a machine
learning pipeline that applies XGBoost, an implementation of gradient boosted
decision trees, to predict radial profiles of gas shapes from halo properties.
We show that XGBoost models can accurately predict gas shape profiles in dark
matter haloes. We also explore model interpretability with SHAP, a method that
identifies the most predictive properties at different halo radii. We find that
baryonic properties best predict gas shapes in halo cores, whereas dark matter
shapes are the main predictors in the halo outskirts. This work demonstrates
the power of interpretable machine learning in modelling observable properties
of dark matter haloes in the era of multi-wavelength cosmological surveys.

to the innermost $700$ pc robustly with high efficiency. Following
Schwarzschild's orbit-based method, we have also developed a simplified model
to calculate the DDM halo density profiles, which agree remarkably well with
those from N-body simulations. Both zoom-in simulations and the simplified
model reveal that dark matter decays lead to the flattening of central density
and overall reduction of density in dwarf halos, and the underlying physics
mechanisms are well illustrated by the simplified model. The slowly-rising
scaled rotation curves of DDM dwarf halos agree with the observation of local

          <p>We study how tidal streams from globular clusters may be used to constrain
the mass of ultra-light dark matter particles, called `fuzzy' dark matter
(FDM). A general feature of FDM models is the presence of ubiquitous density
fluctuations in bound, virialized dark matter structures, on the scale of the
de Broglie wavelength, arising from wave interference in the evolving dark
matter distribution. These time-varying fluctuations can disturb the motions of
stars, leading to potentially observable signatures in cold thin tidal streams
in our own Galaxy. The study of this effect has been hindered by the difficulty
in simulating the FDM wavefunction in Milky Way-sized systems. We present a
simple method to evolve realistic wavefunctions in nearly static potentials,
that should provide an accurate estimate of this granulation effect. We
quantify the impact of FDM perturbations on tidal streams, and show that
initially, while stream perturbations are small in amplitude, their power
spectra exhibit a sharp cutoff corresponding to the de Broglie wavelength of
the FDM potential fluctuations. Eventually, when stream perturbations become
nonlinear, fold caustics generically arise that lead to density fluctuations
with universal behavior. This erases the signature of the de Broglie wavelength
in the stream density power spectrum, but we show that it will still be
possible to determine the FDM mass in this regime, by considering the
fluctuations in quantities like angular momenta or actions.

          <p>Intensity mapping of 21-cm line by several radio telescope experiments will
probe the large-scale structure of the Universe in the post-reionization epoch.
It requires a theoretical framework of neutral hydrogen (HI) clustering, such
as modelling of HI power spectrum for Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)
analysis. We propose a new method for reconstructing the HI map from dark
matter distribution using N-body simulations. Several studies attempt to
compute the HI power spectrum with N-body simulations by pasting HI gas at the
dark matter halo centre, assuming the relation between the halo and HI masses.
On the other hand, the method proposed in this paper reproduces the HI power
spectrum from simulated dark matter distribution truncated at specific scales
from the halo centre. With this method, the slope of HI power spectrum is
reproduced well at the BAO scales, $k&lt;1 h/{\rm Mpc}$. Furthermore, we find the
fluctuation of spin temperature, which is often ignored at the
post-reionization epoch, alters the power spectrum of brightness temperature by
at most 8% in the power spectrum. Finally, we discuss how our method works by
comparing the density profiles of HI and dark matter around the dark matter

          <p>The early Universe may have passed through an extended period of
matter-dominated expansion following inflation and prior to the onset of
radiation domination. Sub-horizon density perturbations grow gravitationally
during such an epoch, collapsing into bound structures if it lasts long enough.
The strong analogy between this phase and structure formation in the
present-day universe allows the use of N-body simulations and approximate
methods for halo formation to model the fragmentation of the inflaton
condensate into inflaton halos. For a simple model we find these halos have
masses of up to $20\,\mathrm{kg}$ and radii of the order of
$10^{-20}\,\mathrm{m}$, roughly $10^{-24}$ seconds after the Big Bang. We find
that the N-body halo mass function matches predictions of the mass-Peak Patch
method and the Press-Schechter formalism within the expected range of scales. A
long matter-dominated phase would imply that reheating and thermalization
occurs in a universe with large variations in density, potentially modifying
the dynamics of this process. In addition, large overdensities can source
gravitational waves and may lead to the formation of primordial black holes.

          <p>Atomic fine structure lines have been detected in the local Universe and at
high redshifts over the past decades. The [C II] emission line at 158 $\mu$m is
an important observable as it provides constraints on the interstellar medium
(ISM) cooling processes. We develop a physically motivated framework to
simulate the production of far-infrared line emission from galaxies in a
cosmological context. This first paper sets out our methodology and describes
its first application, simulating the [C II] 158 $\mu$m line emission in the
local Universe. We combine the output from EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations with a multi-phase model of the ISM. Gas particles are divided into
three phases: dense molecular gas, neutral atomic gas and diffuse ionised gas
(DIG). We estimate the [C II] line emission from the three phases using a set
of Cloudy cooling tables. Our results agree with previous findings regarding
the contribution of these three ISM phases to the [C II] emission. Our model
shows good agreement with the observed ${\rm L_{[C II]}}$-star formation rate
(SFR) relation in the local Universe within 0.4 dex scatter. The fractional
contribution to the [C II] line from different ISM phases depends on the total
SFR and metallicity. The neutral gas phase dominates the [C II] emission in
galaxies with $\rm{SFR}\sim0.01$-$1\,\rm{M_{\odot}}\,\rm{yr^{-1}}$, but the
ionised phase dominates at lower SFRs. Galaxies above solar metallicity exhibit
lower ${\rm L_{[C II]}}$/SFR ratios for the neutral phase. In comparison, the
${\rm L_{[C II]}}$/SFR ratio in the DIG is stable when metallicity varies. We
suggest that the reduced size of the neutral clouds, caused by increased SFRs,
is the likely cause for the ${\rm L_{[C II]}}$ deficit at high infrared
luminosities, although EAGLE simulations do not reach these luminosities at
$z=0$.

          <p>We investigate the power spectrum of Non-Cold Dark Matter (NCDM) produced in
a state out of thermal equilibrium. We consider dark matter production from the
decay of scalar condensates (inflaton, moduli), the decay of thermalized and
non-thermalized particles, and from thermal and non-thermal freeze-in. For each
case, we compute the NCDM phase space distribution and the linear matter power
spectrum, which features a cutoff analogous to that for Warm Dark Matter (WDM).
This scale is solely determined by the equation of state of NCDM. We propose a
mapping procedure that translates the WDM Lyman-$\alpha$ mass bound to NCDM
scenarios. This procedure does not require expensive ad hoc numerical
computations of the non-linear matter power spectrum. By applying it, we obtain
bounds on several NCDM possibilities, ranging from $m_{\rm DM}\gtrsim {\rm
EeV}$ for DM production from inflaton decay with a low reheating temperature,
to sub-keV values for non-thermal freeze-in. We discuss the phenomenological
implications of these results for specific examples which include
strongly-stabilized and non-stabilized supersymmetric moduli, gravitino

probed by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). In this work we develop a detection
algorithm for a GW burst from a cusp on a cosmic string, and apply it to Parkes

          <p>Theoretically modelling the 21-cm signals caused by Population III stars (Pop
III stars) is the key to extracting fruitful information on Pop III stars from
current and forthcoming 21-cm observations. In this work we develop a new
module of Pop III stars in which the escape fractions of ionizing photons and
Lyman-Werner (LW) photons, photo-heating by UV radiation, and LW feedback are
consistently incorporated. By implementing the module into a public 21-cm
semi-numerical simulation code, 21CMFAST, we demonstrate 21-cm signal
calculations and investigate the importance of Pop III star modelling. What we
find is that the contribution from Pop III stars to cosmic reionization
significantly depends on the treatment of the escape fraction. With our escape
fraction model, Pop III stars hardly contribute to reionization because less
massive halos, whose escape fraction are high, cannot host Pop III stars due to
LW feedback. On the other hand, Pop III stars well contribute to reionization
with the conventional constant escape fraction. We also find that UV
photo-heating has non-negligible impact on the 21-cm global signal and the
21-cm power spectrum if the ionization fraction of the Universe is higher than
roughly 1 percent. In this case, the strength of the 21-cm global signal
depends on the photo-heating efficiency and thus on the Pop III star mass. We
conclude that detailed modelling of Pop III stars is imperative to predict
21-cm observables accurately for future observations.

creating the mock compilation using machine learning and calibrating the
aforementioned correlations through B\'ezier polynomials with a standard
chi-square analysis first and then by means of a hierarchical Bayesian
regression procedure. The corresponding catalogs, built up from the two

          <p>Next-generation galaxy and 21cm intensity mapping surveys will rely on a
combination of the power spectrum and bispectrum for high-precision
measurements of primordial non-Gaussianity. In turn, these measurements will
allow us to distinguish between various models of inflation. However, precision
observations require theoretical precision at least at the same level. We
extend the theoretical understanding of the galaxy bispectrum by incorporating
a consistent general relativistic model of galaxy bias at second order, in the
presence of local primordial non-Gaussianity. The influence of primordial
non-Gaussianity on the bispectrum extends beyond the galaxy bias and the dark
matter density, due to redshift-space effects. The standard redshift-space
distortions at first and second order produce a well-known primordial
non-Gaussian imprint on the bispectrum. Relativistic corrections to
redshift-space distortions generate new contributions to this primordial
non-Gaussian signal, arising from: (1)~a coupling of first-order
scale-dependent bias with first-order relativistic observational effects, and
(2)~linearly evolved non-Gaussianity in the second-order velocity and metric
potentials which appear in relativistic observational effects. Our analysis
allows for a consistent separation of the relativistic `contamination' from the
primordial signal, in order to avoid biasing the measurements by using an
incorrect theoretical model. We show that the bias from using a Newtonian
analysis of the squeezed bispectrum could be $\Delta \fnl\sim 5$ for a Stage IV
H$\alpha$ survey.

if the array is used as a collection of scanning autocorrelation dishes rather

stabilise gain drifts and an absolute calibration based on a multi-component
sky model. We show that it is sufficiently accurate to recover maps of diffuse
celestial emission and point sources over a 10 deg x 30 deg patch of the sky
overlapping with the WiggleZ 11hr field. The reconstructed maps have a good

The residual maps have rms amplitudes below 0.1 K, corresponding to &lt;1% of the

          <p>The discrepancy between early-Universe and direct measurements of the Hubble
constant, known as the Hubble tension, recently became a pressing subject in
high precision cosmology. As a result, a large variety of theoretical models
have been proposed to relieve this tension. In this work we analyze a
conformally-invariant modified gravity (CIMG) model of an evolving
gravitational constant due to the coupling of a scalar field to the Ricci
scalar, which is theoretically advantageous as it has only one free parameter
and its influence is concentrated around matter-radiation equality, as required
for solutions to the Hubble tension based on increasing the sound horizon at
recombination. Inspired by similar recent analyses of so-called
early-dark-energy models, we constrain the CIMG model using a combination of
early and late-Universe cosmological datasets. In addition to the Planck 2018
cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and weak lensing measurements,
baryon acoustic oscillations and the Supernova H0 for the Equation of State
datasets, we also use large-scale structure (LSS) datasets such as the Dark
Energy Survey year 1 and the full-shape power spectrum likelihood from the
Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, including its recent analysis using
effective field theory, to check the effect of the CIMG model on the (milder)
S8 tension between the CMB and LSS. We find that the CIMG model can slightly
relax the Hubble tension, with H0 = 69.6 +- 1.6 km/s/Mpc at 95% CL, while
barely affecting the S8 tension. However, current data does not exhibit strong
preference for CIMG over the standard cosmological model. Lastly, we show that
the planned CMB-S4 experiment will have the sensitivity required to distinguish
between the CIMG model and the more general class of models involving an
evolving gravitational constant.

to the baryon density at the time of BBN. We have re-evaluated the thermal rate

describe with model-independent polynomials; our results are in good agreement
with a similar analysis by LUNA. We then perform a full likelihood analysis
combining BBN and Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) likelihood chains
using the new rate combined with previous measurements and compare with the
results using previous rates. Concordance between BBN and CMB measurements of
the anisotropy spectrum using the old rates was excellent. The predicted
deuterium abundance at the Planck value of the baryon density was $({\rm

compared with the value determined from quasar absorption systems $({\rm

$({\rm D/H})_{\rm BBN+CMB} = (2.51 \pm 0.11) \times 10^{-5}$. We thus find
consistency among BBN theory, deuterium and ${}^4$He observations, and the CMB,
when using reaction rates fit in our data-driven approach. We also find that
the new reaction data tightens the constraints on the number of relativistic
degrees of freedom during BBN, giving the effective number of light neutrino

          <p>Weak gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is an
important cosmological tool that allows us to learn about the structure,
composition and evolution of the Universe. Upcoming CMB experiments, such as
the Simons Observatory (SO), will provide high-resolution and low-noise CMB
measurements. We consider the impact of instrumental systematics on the
corresponding high-precision lensing reconstruction power spectrum
measurements. We simulate CMB temperature and polarization maps for an SO-like
instrument and potential scanning strategy, and explore systematics relating to
beam asymmetries and offsets, boresight pointing, gain drifts, gain calibration

potential mitigation techniques for the more significant systematics, and pave

          <p>Feedback processes by active galactic nuclei in the centres of galaxy
clusters appear to prevent large-scale cooling flows and impede star formation.
However, the detailed heating mechanism remains uncertain. One promising
heating scenario invokes the dissipation of Alfv\'en waves that are generated
by streaming cosmic rays (CRs). In order to study this idea, we use
three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations with the AREPO code that
follow the evolution of jet-inflated bubbles that are filled with CRs in a
turbulent cluster atmosphere. We find that a single injection event produces
the CR distribution and heating rate required for a successful CR heating
model. As a bubble rises buoyantly, cluster magnetic fields drape around the
leading interface and are amplified to strengths that balance the ram pressure.
Together with helical magnetic fields in the bubble, this initially confines
the CRs and suppresses the formation of interface instabilities. But as the
bubble continues to rise, bubble-scale eddies significantly amplify radial
magnetic filaments in its wake and enable CR transport from the bubble to the
cooling intracluster medium. By varying the jet parameters, we obtain a rich
and diverse set of jet and bubble morphologies ranging from Fanaroff-Riley type
I-like (FRI) to FRII-like jets. We identify jet energy as the leading order
parameter (keeping the ambient density profiles fixed), whereas jet luminosity
is primarily responsible for setting the Mach numbers of shocks around
FRII-like sources. Our simulations also produce FRI-like jets that inflate
bubbles without detectable shocks and show morphologies consistent with cluster
observations.

          <p>The primary advantage of moderately superheated bubble chamber detectors is
their simultaneous sensitivity to nuclear recoils from WIMP dark matter and
insensitivity to electron recoil backgrounds. A comprehensive analysis of PICO
gamma calibration data demonstrates for the first time that electron recoils in
C$_3$F$_8$ scale in accordance with a new nucleation mechanism, rather than one
driven by a hot-spike as previously supposed. Using this semi-empirical model,
bubble chamber nucleation thresholds may be tuned to be sensitive to lower
energy nuclear recoils while maintaining excellent electron recoil rejection.
The PICO-40L detector will exploit this model to achieve thermodynamic
thresholds as low as 2.8 keV while being dominated by single-scatter events
from coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering of solar neutrinos. In one
year of operation, PICO-40L can improve existing leading limits from PICO on
spin-dependent WIMP-proton coupling by nearly an order of magnitude for WIMP
masses greater than 3 GeV c$^{-2}$ and will have the ability to surpass all
existing non-xenon bounds on spin-independent WIMP-nucleon coupling for WIMP

          <p>Motivated by the old trans-Planckian (TP) problem of inflationary cosmology,
it has been conjectured that any consistent effective field theory should keep
TP modes `hidden' behind the Hubble horizon, so as to prevent them from turning
classical and thereby affecting macroscopic observations. In this paper we
present two arguments against the Hubble horizon being a scale of singular
significance as has been put forward in the TP Censorship Conjecture (TCC).
First, refinements of TCC are presented that allow for the TP modes to grow
beyond the horizon while still keeping the de-Sitter conjecture valid. Second,
we show that TP modes can turn classical even well within the Hubble horizon,
which, as such, negates this rationale behind keeping them from crossing it.
The role of TP modes is known to be less of a problem in warm inflation,
because fluctuations start out usually as classical. This allows warm inflation
to be more resilient to the TP problem compared to cold inflation. To
understand how robust this is, we identity limits where quantum modes can
affect the primordial power spectrum in one specific case.

          <p>We study correlated fluctuations of Type~Ia supernova observables due to
peculiar velocities of both the observer and the supernova host galaxies, and
their impact on cosmological parameter estimation. We demonstrate using the
CosmicFlows-3 dataset that at low redshifts the corrections for peculiar
velocities in the JLA catalogue have been systematically underestimated. By
querying a horizon-size N-body simulation we find that compared to a randomly
placed observer, an observer in an environment like our local Universe will see
2-8 times stronger correlations between supernovae in the JLA catalogue. Hence
the covariances usually employed assuming a typical observer are unphysical and
underestimate the effects of coherent motion of the supernova host galaxies.
Contrary to previous studies which asserted that this should have negligible
effect on cosmological parameter estimation, we find that when peculiar
velocities are treated consistently the JLA data favours significantly smaller
values of the dark energy density than in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. A
joint fit to simultaneously determine the cosmological parameters and the bulk
flow indicates that the latter is around 250 km/s even beyond 200$h^{-1}$ Mpc.
The local bulk flow is thus an essential nuisance parameter which must be
included in cosmological model fitting when analysing supernova data.

          <p>After the recent GW170817 event of the two neutron stars merging, many string
corrected cosmological theories confronted the non-viability peril. This was
due to the fact that most of these theories produce massive gravitons
primordially. Among these theories were the ones containing a non-minimal
kinetic coupling correction term in the Lagrangian, which belong to a subclass
of Horndeski theories. In this work we demonstrate how these theories may be
revived and we show how these theories can produce primordial gravitational
waves with speed $c_T^2=1$ in natural units, thus complying with the GW170817
event. As we show, if the gravitational action of an Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet
theory also contains a kinetic coupling of the form $\sim \xi(\phi)
G^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi$, the condition of having primordial
massless gravitons, or equivalently primordial gravitational waves with speed
$c_T^2=1$ in natural units, results to certain conditions on the scalar field
dependent coupling function of the Gauss-Bonnet term, which is also the
non-minimal coupling of the kinetic coupling. We extensively study the
phenomenological implications of such a theory focusing on the inflationary
era, by only assuming slow-roll dynamics for the scalar field. Accordingly, we
briefly study the case that the scalar field evolves in a constant-roll way. By
using some illustrative examples, we demonstrate that the viability of the
theoretical framework at hand may easily be achieved. Also, theories containing
terms of the form $\sim \xi(\phi)\Box\phi
g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi$ and $\sim
\xi(\phi)\left(g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi\right)^2$ also lead
to the same gravitational wave speed as the theory we shall study in this
paper, so this covers a larger class of Horndeski theories.

how ELGs populate haloes. We explore the shape of the average HOD, the fraction
of satellite galaxies, their probability distribution function (PDF), and their
density and velocity profiles. Our baseline HOD shape was fitted to a
semi-analytical model of galaxy formation and evolution, with a decaying
occupation of central ELGs at high halo masses. We consider Poisson and
sub/super-Poissonian PDFs for satellite assignment. We model both NFW and
particle profiles for satellite positions, also allowing for decreased
concentrations. We model velocities with the virial theorem and particle
velocity distributions. Additionally, we introduce a velocity bias and a net
infall velocity. We study how these choices impact the clustering statistics
while keeping the number density and bias fixed to that from eBOSS ELGs. The
projected correlation function, $w_p$, captures most of the effects from the
PDF and satellites profile. The quadrupole, $\xi_2$, captures most of the
effects coming from the velocity profile. We find that the impact of the mean
HOD shape is subdominant relative to the rest of choices. We fit the clustering

assumptions. The catalogues presented here have been analysed in companion

          <p>A crucial problem for partial sky analysis of CMB polarization is the $E$-$B$
leakage problem. Such leakage arises from the presence of `ambiguous' modes
that satisfy properties of both $E$ and $B$ modes. Solving this problem is
critical for primordial polarization $B$ mode detection in partial sky CMB
polarization experiments. In this work we introduce a new method for reducing
the leakage. We demonstrate that if we complement the $E$-mode information
outside the observation patch with ancillary data from full-sky CMB
observations, we can reduce and even effectively remove the $E$-to-$B$ leakage.
For this objective, we produce $E$-mode Stokes $QU$ maps from Wiener filtered
full-sky intensity and polarization CMB observations. We use these maps to fill
the sky region that is not observed by the ground-based experiment of interest,
and thus complement the partial sky Stokes $QU$ maps. Since the $E$-mode
information is now available on the full sky we see a significant reduction in
the $E$-to-$B$ leakage. We evaluate on simulated data sets the performance of
our method for a `shallow' $f_\text{sky}=8\%$, and a `deep' $f_\text{sky}=2\%$
northern hemisphere sky patch, with AliCPT-like properties, and a LSPE-like
$f_\text{sky}=30\%$ sky patch, by combining those observations with Planck-like
full sky polarization maps. We find that our method outperforms the standard
and the pure-$B$ method pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimators for all of our simulations.
Our new method gives unbiased estimates of the $B$-mode power spectrum
through-out the entire multipole range with near-optimal pseudo-$C_\ell$ errors
for $\ell&gt;20$. We also study the application of our method to the CMB-S4
experiment combined with LiteBIRD-like full sky data, and show that using
signal-dominated full sky $E$-mode data we can eliminate the $E$-to-$B$ leakage

          <p>The initial orbits of infalling subhalos largely determine the subsequent
evolution of the subhalos and satellite galaxies therein and shed light on the
assembly of their hosts. Using a large set of cosmological simulations of
various resolutions, we quantify the orbital distribution of subhalos at infall
time and its mass and redshift dependence in a large dynamic range. We further
provide a unified and accurate model validated across cosmic time, which can
serve as the initial condition for semi-analytic models. We find that the
infall velocity $v$ follows a nearly universal distribution peaked near the
host virial velocity $V_{\mathrm{h}}$ for any subhalo mass or redshift, while
the infall orbit is most radially biased when $v\sim V_{\mathrm{h}}$. Moreover,
subhalos that have a higher host mass or a higher sub-to-host ratio tend to
move along a more radial direction with a relatively smaller angular momentum
than their low host mass or low sub-to-host ratio counterparts, though they
share the same normalized orbital energy. These relations are nearly
independent of the redshift when using the density peak height as the proxy for
host halo mass. The above trends are consistent with the scenario where the
dynamical environment is relatively colder for more massive structures because
their own gravity is more likely to dominate the local potentials. Based on
this understanding, the more massive or isolated halos are expected to have
higher velocity anisotropy.

          <p>The analysis of optical images of galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lensing
systems can provide important information about the distribution of dark matter
at small scales. However, the modeling and statistical analysis of these images
is extraordinarily complex, bringing together source image and main lens
reconstruction, hyper-parameter optimization, and the marginalization over
small-scale structure realizations. We present here a new analysis pipeline
that tackles these diverse challenges by bringing together many recent machine
learning developments in one coherent approach, including variational
inference, Gaussian processes, differentiable probabilistic programming, and
neural likelihood-to-evidence ratio estimation. Our pipeline enables: (a) fast
reconstruction of the source image and lens mass distribution, (b) variational
estimation of uncertainties, (c) efficient optimization of source
regularization and other hyperparameters, and (d) marginalization over
stochastic model components like the distribution of substructure. We present
here preliminary results that demonstrate the validity of our approach.

          <p>Slow-roll inflation is analyzed in the context of modified gravity within the
Palatini formalism. As shown in the literature, inflation in this framework
requires the presence of non-traceless matter, otherwise it does not occur just
as a consequence of the non-linear gravitational terms of the action.
Nevertheless, by including a single scalar field that plays the role of the
inflaton, slow-roll inflation can be performed in these theories, where the
equations lead to an effective potential that modifies the dynamics. We obtain
the general slow-roll parameters and analyze a simple model to illustrate the
differences introduced by the gravitational terms under the Palatini approach,
and the modifications on the spectral index and the tensor to scalar ratio
predicted by the model.

          <p>We present a testable mechanism of low-scale baryogenesis and dark matter
production in which neither baryon nor lepton number are violated. Charged $D$
mesons are produced out-of-equilibrium at tens of MeV temperatures. The $D$
mesons quickly undergo CP-violating decays to charged pions, which then decay
into dark-sector leptons without violating lepton number. To transfer this
lepton asymmetry to the baryon asymmetry, the dark leptons scatter on
additional dark-sector states charged under lepton and baryon number.
Amusingly, this transfer proceeds without electroweak sphalerons, which are no
longer active at such low scales. We present two example models which can
achieve this transfer while remaining consistent with current limits. The
required amount of CP violation in charged $D$ meson decays, while currently
allowed, will be probed by colliders. Additionally, the relevant decays of
charged pions to dark-sector leptons have been constrained by the PIENU
experiment and will be further explored in upcoming experiments.

          <p>We demonstrate the impact on forecasted neutrino mass constraints of
extending galaxy clustering and CMB lensing predictions from linear to
next-to-leading-order power spectra. The redshift-space 1-loop power spectrum
model we adopt requires an additional four free bias parameters, a velocity
bias parameter and two new stochastic parameters. These additional nuisance
parameters appreciably weaken the constraints on $M_\nu$. CMB lensing plays a
significant role in helping to alleviate these degeneracies and tighten the
final constraints. The constraint on the optical depth to reionisation $\tau$
has a strong effect on the constraint on $M_\nu$, but only when CMB lensing is
included in the analysis to keep the degeneracies with the nuisance parameters
under control. We also extract constraints when 1) using the BAO signature only
as a distance probe, and 2) isolating the scale-dependence of the power
spectrum, which, as shown in previous work, provides a cosmology-independent
probe of $M_\nu$. All constraints except the latter remain strongly sensitive
to the assumption of a flat $\Lambda$CDM universe. We perform an analysis of
the magnitude of the shift introduced in the inferred $M_\nu$ value when
neglecting nonlinear corrections, and show that, for a Euclid-like survey, this
shift becomes roughly equal to the 1$\sigma$ constraint itself even with a
conservative cut-off scale of $k_{max} = 0.1~h~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We also perform
a calculation of the appropriate expected bias in neutrino mass caused by not
including the next, 2-loop order and expect a shift of only about 20% of the
1$\sigma$ error for $k_{max}=0.2~h~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ in a Euclid-like survey.

          <p>We systematically investigate the preheating behavior of single field
inflation with an oscillon-supporting potential. We compute the properties of
the emitted gravitational waves (GWs) and the number density and
characteristics of the produced oscillons. By performing numerical simulations
for a variety of potential types, we divide the analyzed potentials in two
families, each of them containing potentials with varying large- or small-field
dependence. We find that the shape and amplitude of the emitted GW spectrum
have a universal feature, with the peak around the physical wavenumber $k/a
\sim m$ at the inflaton oscillation period, irrespective of the exact potential
shape. This can be used as a smoking-gun for deducing the existence of a
violent preheating phase and possible oscillon formation after inflation.
Despite this apparent universality, we find differences in the shape of the
emitted GW spectra between the two potential families, leading to
discriminating features between them. In particular, all potentials show the
emergence of a two-peak structure in the GW spectrum, arising at the time of
oscillon formation. However, potentials exhibiting efficient parametric
resonance tend to smear out this structure and by the end of the simulation the
GW spectrum exhibits a single broad peak. We further compute the properties of
the produced oscillons for each potential, finding differences in the number
density and size distribution of stable oscillons and transient overdensities.
We perform a linear fluctuation analysis and use Floquet charts to relate the
results of our simulations to the structure of parametric resonance. We find
that the growth rate of scalar perturbations and the associated oscillon
formation time are sensitive to the small-field potential shape while the
macroscopic physical properties of oscillons (e.g. total number) depend on the
large-field potential shape.
