          <p>Galaxy clusters grow by merging with other clusters, giving rise to Mpc-wide
shock waves that travel at 1000-2500 km/s through the intra-cluster medium. To
study the effects of merger shocks on the properties of cluster galaxies, we
present the first spatially resolved spectroscopic view of 5 H$\alpha$ emitting
galaxies located in the wake of shock fronts in the low redshift (z~0.2),
massive (~2$\times10^{15}$ M$_\odot$), post-core passage merging cluster, CIZA
J2242.8+5301 (nicknamed the `Sausage'). Our Gemini/GMOS-N integral field unit
(IFU) observations, designed to capture H$\alpha$ and [NII] emission, reveal
the nebular gas distribution, kinematics and metallicities in the galaxies over
&gt;16 kpc scales. While the galaxies show evidence for rotational support, the
flux and velocity maps have complex features like tails and gas outflows
aligned with the merger axis of the cluster. With gradients incompatible with
inside-out disk growth, the metallicity maps are consistent with sustained SF
throughout and outside of the galactic disks. In combination with previous
results, these pilot observations provide further evidence of a likely
connection between cluster mergers and SF triggering in cluster galaxies, a
potentially fundamental discovery revealing the interaction of galaxies with
their environment.

          <p>We discuss several low-energy backgrounds to sub-GeV dark matter searches,
which arise from high-energy particles of cosmic or radioactive origin that
interact with detector materials. We focus on Cherenkov radiation, transition
radiation, and luminescence or phonons from electron-hole pair recombination,
and show that these processes are an important source of backgrounds at both
current and planned detectors. We perform detailed analyses of these
backgrounds at several existing and proposed experiments. We find that a large
fraction of the observed single-electron events in the SENSEI 2020 run
originate from Cherenkov photons generated by high-energy events in the
Skipper-CCD, and from recombination photons generated in a phosphorus-doped
layer of the same instrument. In a SuperCDMS HVeV 2020 run, Cherenkov photons
produced in the sensor holders likely explain the origin of most of the events
containing 2 to 6 electrons. At SuperCDMS SNOLAB, Cherenkov radiation from
radioactive contaminants in Cirlex could dominate the low-energy backgrounds.
For EDELWEISS, Cherenkov or luminescence backgrounds are subdominant to their
observed event rate, but could still limit the sensitivity of their future
searches. We also point out that Cherenkov radiation, transition radiation, and
recombination could be a significant source of backgrounds at future
experiments aiming to detect dark-matter via scintillation or phonon signals.
The implications of our results for sub-GeV dark-matter searches and for the
design of future detectors are significant. In particular, several design
strategies to mitigate these backgrounds can be implemented, such as minimizing
non-conductive materials near the target, implementing active and passive
shielding, and using multiple detectors. Finally, we speculate on the
implications of our results for the development of quantum computers and
neutrino detectors.

          <p>Observations of metal absorption systems in the spectra of distant quasars
allow to constrain a possible variation of the fine-structure constant
throughout the history of the Universe. Such a test poses utmost demands on the
wavelength accuracy and previous studies were limited by systematics in the
spectrograph wavelength calibration. A substantial advance in the field is
therefore expected from the new ultra-stable high-resolution spectrograph
Espresso, recently installed at the VLT. In preparation of the fundamental
physics related part of the Espresso GTO program, we present a thorough
assessment of the Espresso wavelength accuracy and identify possible
systematics at each of the different steps involved in the wavelength
calibration process. Most importantly, we compare the default wavelength
solution, based on the combination of Thorium-Argon arc lamp spectra and a
Fabry-P\'erot interferometer, to the fully independent calibration obtained
from a laser frequency comb. We find wavelength-dependent discrepancies of up
to 24m/s. This substantially exceeds the photon noise and highlights the
presence of different sources of systematics, which we characterize in detail
as part of this study. Nevertheless, our study demonstrates the outstanding
accuracy of Espresso with respect to previously used spectrographs and we show
that constraints of a relative change of the fine-structure constant at the
$10^{-6}$ level can be obtained with Espresso without being limited by
wavelength calibration systematics.

          <p>The study of velocity fields of the hot gas in galaxy clusters can help to
unravel details of microphysics on small-scales and to decipher the nature of
feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Likewise, magnetic fields as traced
by Faraday rotation measurements (RMs) inform about their impact on gas
dynamics as well as on cosmic ray production and transport. We investigate the
inherent relationship between large-scale gas kinematics and magnetic fields
through non-radiative magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the creation,
evolution and disruption of AGN jet-inflated lobes in an isolated Perseus-like
galaxy cluster, with and without pre-existing turbulence. In particular, we
connect cluster velocity measurements with mock RM maps to highlight their
underlying physical connection, which opens up the possibility of comparing
turbulence levels in two different observables. For single jet outbursts, we
find only a local impact on the velocity field, i.e. the associated increase in
velocity dispersion is not volume-filling. Furthermore, in a setup with
pre-existing turbulence, this increase in velocity dispersion is largely
hidden. We use mock X-ray observations to show that at arcmin resolution, the
velocity dispersion is therefore dominated by existing large-scale turbulence
and is only minimally altered by the presence of a jet. For the velocity
structure of central gas uplifted by buoyantly rising lobes, we find fast,
coherent outflows with low velocity dispersion. Our results highlight that
projected velocity distributions show complex structures which pose challenges
for the interpretation of observations.

          <p>The study of the luminosity contribution from TP-AGB stars to the stellar
populations of galaxies is crucial to determine their physical parameters
(e.g., stellar mass and age). We use a sample of 84 nearby disk galaxies to
explore diverse stellar population synthesis models with different luminosity
contributions from TP-AGB stars. We fit the models to optical and NIR
photometry, on a pixel by pixel basis. The statistics of the fits show a
preference for a low luminosity contribution (i.e., high mass-to-light ratio in
the NIR) from TP-AGB stars. Nevertheless, for 30-40 % of the pixels in our
sample a high luminosity contribution (hence low mass-to-light ratio in the
NIR) from TP-AGB stars is favored. According to our findings, the mean TP-AGB
star luminosity contribution in nearby disk galaxies may vary with Hubble type.
This may be a consequence of the variation of the TP-AGB mass-loss rate with
metallicity, if metal-poor stars begin losing mass earlier than metal-rich
stars, because of a pre-dust wind that precedes the dust-driven wind.

          <p>Inflation drives quantum fluctuations beyond the Hubble horizon, freezing
them out before the small-scale modes re-enter during the radiation dominated
epoch, and subsequently decay, while large-scale modes re-enter later during
the matter dominated epoch and grow. This distinction shapes the matter power
spectrum and provides observational evidence in support of the standard model.
In this paper, we demonstrate that another mechanism, based on the fluctuation
growth in the R_h=ct universe, itself an FLRW cosmology with the added
constraint of zero active mass (i.e., rho+3p=0), also accounts very well for
the observed matter power spectrum, so this feature is not unique to LambdaCDM.
In R_h=ct, the shape of the matter power spectrum is set by the interplay
between the more rapid decay of the gravitational potential for the smaller
mode wavelengths and the longer dynamical timescale for the larger wavelengths.
This combination produces a characteristic peak that grows in both amplitude
and mode number as a function of time. Today, that peak lies at k approx 0.02
Mpc^-1, in agreement with the Ly-alpha and Planck data. But there is no need of
an inflationary expansion, and a complicated epoch dependence as one finds in
LambdaCDM.

          <p>Strong lensing by galaxy clusters can be used to significantly expand the
survey reach, thus allowing observation of magnified high-redshift supernovae
that otherwise would remain undetected. Strong lensing can also provide
multiple images of the galaxies that lie behind the clusters. Detection of
strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is especially useful because of
their standardizable brightness, as they can be used to improve either cluster
lensing models or independent measurements of cosmological parameters. The
cosmological parameter, the Hubble constant, is of particular interest given
the discrepancy regarding its value from measurements with different
approaches. Here, we explore the feasibility of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory
Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of detecting strongly lensed SNe in the
field of five galaxy clusters (Abell 1689 and Hubble Frontier Fields clusters)
that have well-studied lensing models. Considering the 88 systems composed of
268 individual multiple images in the five cluster fields, we find that the
LSST will be sensitive to SNe~Ia (SNe~IIP) exploding in 41 (23) galaxy images.
The range of redshift of these galaxies is between $1.01 &lt; z &lt; 3.05$. During
its 10 years of operation, LSST is expected to detect $0.2\pm0.1$ SN~Ia and
$0.9\pm0.3$ core collapse SNe. However, as LSST will observe many more massive
galaxy clusters, it is likely that the expectations are higher. We stress the
importance of having an additional observing program for photometric and
spectroscopic follow-up of the strongly lensed SNe detected by LSST.

three-point correlation function, we use machine learning techniques to recover
the mean bubble size and global ionisation fraction from correlations in the

have been perfectly removed and negligible instrumental noise. Using ionisation
fraction data, our best MLP model recovers the mean bubble size with a median
prediction error of around 10%, or from the 21cm differential brightness
temperature with median prediction error of around 14%. A further two MLP
models recover the global ionisation fraction with median prediction errors of
around 4% (using ionisation fraction data) or around 16% (using brightness
temperature). Our results indicate that clustering in both the ionisation
fraction field and the brightness temperature field encode useful information
about the progress of the Epoch of Reionization in a complementary way to other
summary statistics. Using clustering would be particularly useful in regimes
where high signal-to-noise ratio prevents direct measurement of bubble size
statistics. We compare the quality of MLP models using the power spectrum, and
find that using the three-point correlation function outperforms the power
spectrum at predicting both global ionisation fraction and mean bubble size.

versatility in sampling from complicated probability distributions. However, as
the dimension of the distribution gets larger, the computational costs for a
satisfactory exploration of the sampling space become challenging. Adaptive
MCMC methods employing a choice of proposal distribution can address this issue
speeding up the convergence. In this paper we show an alternative way of
performing adaptive MCMC, by using the outcome of Bayesian Neural Networks as
the initial proposal for the Markov Chain. This combined approach increases the

          <p>Swampland Conjectures have attracted quite some interest in the Cosmological
Community. They have been shown to have wide ranging implications , like
Constraints on Inflationary Models, Primordial Black Holes etc. to name a few.
A particularly revealing insight on dark energy also shows that one can have
the dark energy equation of state for a quintessence scenario to be
signficantly different than -1 after one takes into account the refined dS
conjecture. Another interesting issue with the swampland conjectures is that
they have been shown to be incompatible with single field inflationary models
in GR based cosmology. In our previous work we have, however, showed that
single field inflationary models are quite compatible with swampland
conjectures in their usual string theoretic form in a large class of modified
cosmological scenarios. Building on that work, we now show that in modified
cosmological scenarios where the early universe expansion was driven by single
field inflation , one can have the dark energy equation of state to be
significantly different from -1 even if we just take into account the original
dS conjecture, let alone the refined form of that. We thereby show that one
does not need to apply a step function approach towards inflation in order to
have an observable distinction between constant and non constant dark energy
models in the context of the swampland conjectures.

          <p>Radio relics are diffuse, extended synchrotron sources that originate from
shock fronts generated during cluster mergers. The massive merging galaxy
cluster MACS J0717.5+3745 hosts one of the more complex relics known to date.
We present upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope band 3 (300-500 MHz) and
band 4 (550-850 MHz) observations. These new observations, combined with
published VLA and the new LOFAR HBA data, allow us to carry out a detailed,
high spatial resolution spectral analysis of the relic over a broad range of
frequencies. The integrated spectrum of the relic closely follows a power-law
between 144 MHz and 5.5 GHz with a mean spectral slope $\alpha=-1.16\pm0.03$.
Despite its complex morphology, the subregions of the relic and the other
isolated filaments also follow power-law behaviors, and show similar spectral
slopes. Assuming Diffusive Shock Acceleration, we estimate a dominant Mach
number of $\sim 3.7$ for the shocks that make up the relic. Comparison with
recent numerical simulations suggests that in the case of radio relics, the
slopes of the integrated radio spectra are determined by the Mach number of the
accelerating shock, with $\alpha$ nearly constant, namely between $-1.13$ and
$-1.17$, for Mach numbers $3.5 - 4.0$. The spectral shapes inferred from
spatially resolved regions show curvature, we speculate that the relic is
inclined along the line-of-sight. The locus of points in the simulated
color-color plots changes significantly with the relic viewing angle. We
conclude that projection effects and inhomogeneities in the shock Mach number
dominate the observed spectral properties of the relic in this complex system.
Based on the new observations we raise the possibility that the relic and a
narrow-angle-tailed radio galaxy are two different structures projected along
the same line-of-sight.

          <p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients and can be
used as a cosmological probe. However, the dispersion measure (DM) contributed
by intergalactic medium (IGM) is hard to be distinguished from other
components. In this paper, we use the IllustrisTNG simulation to realistically
estimate the $DM_{\rm IGM}$ up to $z\sim 9$. We find $DM_{\rm IGM} =
892^{+721}_{-270}$ pc cm$^{-3}$ at $z=1$. The probability distribution of
$DM_{\rm IGM}$ can be well fitted by a quasi-Gaussian function with a long
tail. The tail is caused by the structures along the line of sight in IGM.
Subtracting DM contributions from the Milky Way and host galaxy for localized
FRBs, the $DM_{\rm IGM}$ value is close to the derived $DM_{\rm IGM}-z$
relation. We also show the capability to constrain the cosmic reionization
history with the $DM_{\rm IGM}$ of high-redshift FRBs in the IllustrisTNG
universe. The derived $DM_{\rm IGM}-z$ relation at high redshifts can be well
fitted by a $tanh$ reionization model with the reionization redshift $z=5.95$,
which is compatible with the reionization model used by the IllustrisTNG
simulation. The $DM_{\rm IGM}$ of high-redshift FRBs also provides an
independent way to measure the optical depth of cosmic microwave background
(CMB). Our result can be used to derive the pseudo-redshifts of non-localized
FRBs for $DM_{\rm IGM}&lt;4000$ \ \ pc cm$^{-3}$.

          <p>We demonstrate the potential of an emulator-based approach to analyzing
galaxy formation models in the domain where constraining data is limited. We
have applied the open-source Python package PRISM to the galaxy formation model
Meraxes. Meraxes is a semi-analytic model, purposefully built to study the
growth of galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Constraining such
models is however complicated by the scarcity of observational data in the EoR.
PRISM's ability to rapidly construct accurate approximations of complex
scientific models using minimal data is therefore key to performing this
analysis well.
</p>
<p>This paper provides an overview of our analysis of Meraxes using measurements
of galaxy stellar mass densities; luminosity functions; and color-magnitude
relations. We demonstrate the power of using PRISM instead of a full Bayesian
analysis when dealing with highly correlated model parameters and a scarce set
of observational data. Our results show that the various observational data
sets constrain Meraxes differently and do not necessarily agree with each
other, signifying the importance of using multiple observational data types
when constraining such models. Furthermore, we show that PRISM can detect when
model parameters are too correlated or cannot be constrained effectively. We
conclude that a mixture of different observational data types, even when they
are scarce or inaccurate, is a priority for understanding galaxy formation and
that emulation frameworks like PRISM can guide the selection of such data.

          <p>The dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provides a unique way
to probe ionised baryons in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Cosmological models
with different parameters lead to different DM-redshift ($\mathrm{DM}-z$)
relations. Additionally, the over/under-dense regions in the IGM and the
circumgalactic medium of intervening galaxies lead to scatter around the mean
$\mathrm{DM}-z$ relations. We have used the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies
and their Environments (EAGLE) simulations to measure the mean $\mathrm{DM}-z$
relation and the scatter around it using over one billion lines-of-sight
between redshifts $0&lt;z&lt;3$. We investigated two techniques to estimate
line-of-sight DM: `pixel scrambling' and `box transformations'. We find that
using box transformations (a technique from the literature) causes strong
correlations due to repeated replication of structure. Comparing a linear and
non-linear model, we find that the non-linear model with cosmological
parameters, provides a better fit to the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation. The
differences between these models are the most significant at low redshifts
($z&lt;0.5$). The scatter around the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation is highly
asymmetric, especially at low redshift $\left(z&lt;0.5\right)$, and becomes more
Gaussian as redshift approaches $z\sim3$, the limit of this study. The increase
in Gaussianity with redshift is indicative of the large scale structures that
is better probed with longer lines-of-sight. The minimum simulation size
suitable for investigations into the scatter around the $\mathrm{DM}-z$
relation is 100~comoving~Mpc. The $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation measured in EAGLE is
available with an easy-to-use python interface in the open-source FRB redshift
estimation package FRUITBAT.

employing the RAMSES $N$-body code and extending it with an effective
gravitational constant $G_{eff}$. We implement an environment-dependent
$G_{eff}$ as a function of the graviton mass and the local energy density, as
predicted by MTMG. We find that halo density profiles are not a good probe for
MTMG since deviations from General Relativity are quite small. Similarly, the
matter power spectra show deviations only at percentage level. However, we find
a clear difference between MTMG and GR in that voids are denser in MTMG than in
GR. Since measuring voids profiles is quite a complex task from the
observational point of view, a better probe of MTMG would be the halo
abundances. In this case, MTMG creates a larger amount of massive halos, while
there is a suppression on the abundance of small halos.

          <p>Despite the fact that axions are still elusive and hypothetical particles,
they provide the most elegant solution to the strong CP problem and are also
very compelling candidates for the missing (dark) matter. Axions can be
copiously produced in the early universe via thermal processes, contributing to
the mass-energy density of thermal hot relics, alike massive neutrinos. We
analyze the mixed hot dark matter scenario considering both massive neutrinos
and thermal axion species in light of the most recent cosmological
observations. The tightest $95\%$ CL limit on the axion mass is $m_a&lt;0.192$ eV,
four times smaller than in previous analyses. Interestingly, the most
constraining $95\%$ CL upper bound on the total neutrino mass within this mixed
hot dark matter scenario is $\sum m_\nu&lt; 0.08$ eV, well below the inverted
neutrino mass ordering prediction. Would future axion searches find evidence
for scenarios with thermal axions such that $m_a\gtrsim 0.3$ eV, this would
favor the normal ordering as the one governing the mass pattern of neutral
fermions. If, on the other hand, future terrestrial double beta decay and/or
long baseline neutrino experiments find that the nature mass ordering is the
inverted one, this could rule out a wide region in the currently allowed
thermal axion window. Our results therefore strongly support multi-messenger
searches of axions and neutrino properties, together with joint analyses of
their expected sensitivities.

          <p>Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) have been shown to be powerful probes of the
Universe, in particular to study the star formation rate up to very high
redshift ($z \sim 9$). Since LGRBs are produced by only a small fraction of
massive stars, it is paramount to have a good understanding of their underlying
intrinsic population in order to use them as cosmological probes without
introducing any unwanted bias. The goal of this work is to constrain and
characterise this intrinsic population. We developed a Monte Carlo model where
each burst is described by its redshift and its properties at the peak of the
lightcurve. We derived the best fit parameters by comparing our synthetic
populations to carefully selected observational constraints based on the
CGRO/BATSE, Fermi/GBM and Swift/BAT samples with appropriate flux thresholds.
We explored different scenarios in terms of cosmic evolution of the luminosity
function and/or of the redshift distribution as well as including or not the
presence of intrinsic spectral-energetics (Ep-L) correlations. We find that the
existence of an intrinsic Ep-L correlation is preferred but with a shallower
slope than observed($\alpha_A \sim 0.3$) and a larger scatter ($\sim 0.4$ dex).
We find a strong degeneracy between the cosmic evolution of the luminosity and
of the LGRB rate, and show that a sample both larger and deeper than SHOALS by
a factor of three is needed to lift this degeneracy. The observed We conclude
that Ep-L correlation cannot be explained only by selection effects although
these do play a role in shaping the observed relation. The degeneracy between
cosmic evolution of the luminosity function and of the redshift distribution of
LGRBs should be included in the uncertainties of star formation rate estimates;
these amount to a factor of 10 at $z=6$ and up to a factor of 50 at $z=9$.

          <p>A statistical analysis of the observed perturbations in the density of
stellar streams can in principle set stringent contraints on the mass function
of dark matter subhaloes, which in turn can be used to constrain the mass of
the dark matter particle. However, the likelihood of a stellar density with
respect to the stream and subhaloes parameters involves solving an intractable
inverse problem which rests on the integration of all possible forward
realisations implicitly defined by the simulation model. In order to infer the
subhalo abundance, previous analyses have relied on Approximate Bayesian
Computation (ABC) together with domain-motivated but handcrafted summary
statistics. Here, we introduce a likelihood-free Bayesian inference pipeline
based on Amortised Approximate Likelihood Ratios (AALR), which automatically
learns a mapping between the data and the simulator parameters and obviates the
need to handcraft a possibly insufficient summary statistic. We apply the
method to the simplified case where stellar streams are only perturbed by dark
matter subhaloes, thus neglecting baryonic substructures, and describe several
diagnostics that demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method and the
statistical quality of the learned estimator.

          <p>We present a neural-network emulator for baryonic effects in the non-linear
matter power spectrum. We calibrate this emulator using more than 50,000
measurements in a 15-dimensional parameters space, varying cosmology and
baryonic physics. Baryonic physics is described through a baryonification
algorithm, that has been shown to accurately capture the relevant effects on
the power spectrum and bispectrum in state-of-the-art hydrodynamical
simulations. Cosmological parameters are sampled using a cosmology-rescaling
approach including massive neutrinos and dynamical dark energy. The specific
quantity we emulate is the ratio between matter power spectrum with baryons and
gravity-only, and we estimate the overall precision of the emulator to be 1-2%,
at all scales 0.01 &lt; k &lt; 5 h/Mpc, and redshifts 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5. We also obtain an
accuracy of 1-2%, when testing the emulator against a collection of 74
different cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and their respective
gravity-only counterparts. We show also that only one baryonic parameter,
namely Mc, which set the gas fraction retained per halo mass, is enough to have
accurate and realistic predictions of the baryonic feedback at a given epoch.

          <p>We investigate the complete universe evolution in the framework of $f(T)$
cosmology. We first study the requirements at the kinematic level and we
introduce a simple scale factor with the necessary features. Performing a
detailed analysis of the phase portrait we show that the universe begins in the
infinite past from a phase where the scale factor goes to zero but the Hubble
parameter goes to a constant, and its derivative to zero. Since these features
resemble those of the Pseudo-Rip fate but in a revered way, we call this
initial phase as Pseudo-Bang. Then the universe evolves in a first inflationary
phase, a cosmological turnaround and a bounce, after which we have a second
inflationary regime with a successful exit. Subsequently we obtain the standard
thermal history and the sequence of radiation, matter and late-time
acceleration epochs, showing that the universe will result in an everlasting
Pseudo-Rip phase. Finally, taking advantage of the fact that the field
equations of $f(T)$ gravity are of second order, and therefore the
corresponding autonomous dynamical system is one dimensional, we incorporate
the aforementioned kinematic features and we reconstruct the specific $f(T)$
form that can dynamically generate the Pseudo-Bang cosmological scenario.
Lastly, we examine the evolution of the primordial fluctuations showing that
they are initially sub-horizon, and we show that the total fluid does not
exhibit any singular behaviour at the phantom crossing points, while the
torsional fluid experiences them as Type II singular phases.

Given an input for the velocity field of member galaxies, the code solves the

          <p>We present a method to include lensing selection effects due to the finite
horizon of a given detector when studying lensing of gravitational wave (GW)
sources. When selection effects are included, the mean of the magnification
distribution is shifted from one to higher values for sufficiently
high-redshift sources. This introduces an irreducible (multiplicative) bias on
the luminosity distance reconstruction, in addition to the typical source of
uncertainty in the distance determination. We apply this method to study
lensing of GWs emitted by massive black hole binary mergers at high redshift
detectable by LISA. We estimate the expected bias induced by selection effects
on the luminosity distance reconstruction as function of cosmological redshift,
and discuss its implications for cosmological and astrophysical analyses with
LISA. We also reconstruct the distribution of lensing magnification as a
function of the observed luminosity distance to a source, that is the
observable quantity in the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart. Lensing
provides the dominant source of errors in distance measurements of
high-redshift GW sources. Its full characterisation, including the impact of
selection effects, is of paramount importance to correctly determine the
astrophysical properties of the underlying source population and to be able to

          <p>Motivated by recent developments in perturbative calculations of the
nonlinear evolution of large-scale structure, we present an iterative algorithm
to reconstruct the initial conditions in a given volume starting from the dark
matter distribution in real space. In our algorithm, objects are first moved
back iteratively along estimated potential gradients, with a progressively
reduced smoothing scale, until a nearly uniform catalog is obtained. The linear
initial density is then estimated as the divergence of the cumulative
displacement, with an optional second-order correction. This algorithm should
undo nonlinear effects up to one-loop order, including the higher-order
infrared resummation piece. We test the method using dark matter simulations in
real space. At redshift $z=0$, we find that after eight iterations the
reconstructed density is more than $95\%$ correlated with the initial density
at $k\le 0.35\; h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The reconstruction also reduces the power
in the difference between reconstructed and initial fields by more than 2
orders of magnitude at $k\le 0.2\; h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and it extends the
range of scales where the full broadband shape of the power spectrum matches
linear theory by a factor of 2-3. As a specific application, we consider
measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale that can be
improved by reducing the degradation effects of large-scale flows. In our
idealized dark matter simulations, the method improves the BAO signal-to-noise
ratio by a factor of 2.7 at $z=0$ and by a factor of 2.5 at $z=0.6$, improving
standard BAO reconstruction by $70\%$ at $z=0$ and $30\%$ at $z=0.6$, and
matching the optimal BAO signal and signal-to-noise ratio of the linear density
in the same volume. For BAO, the iterative nature of the reconstruction is the
most important aspect.

          <p>Verlinde (2016) has proposed a new modified theory of gravity, Emergent
Gravity (EG), as an alternative to dark matter. EG reproduces the Tully-Fisher
relationship with no free parameters and agrees with the velocity curves of
most massive, spiral galaxies well. In its current form, the theory only
applies to isolated, spherically symmetric systems in a dark energy-dominated
Universe, and thus can only be tested fairly with such systems. This paper
presents a framework for rotation curve tests of EG using isolated dwarf
galaxies. Here I extend the EG equations to axisymmetric distributions for the
first time. I also perform a preliminary test of the predictions from EG versus
the maximum velocity measurements of 452 isolated dwarf galaxies. I find that
EG predicts the maximum velocities of these systems somewhat well for galaxies
with measured velocities around $100~\rm{km/s}$. EG severely underpredicts the
maximum velocities for dwarf galaxies with measured velocities greater than
this value and overpredicts for those with measured velocities less than this
value. Rotation curves of these isolated dwarf galaxies would provide the
definitive test of EG.

scales. Future CMB experiments on the resolution/sensitivity frontier will
measure the kSZ effect with high significance. Through the cross-correlation
with tracers of structure, it will be possible to reconstruct the remote CMB
dipole field (e.g. the CMB dipole observed at different locations in the
Universe) using the technique of kSZ tomography. In this paper, we derive a
quadratic estimator for the remote dipole field using the Cosmic Infrared

The total signal-to-noise of the reconstruction is order unity for current

based on statistical error only. The CIB-based reconstruction is highly
correlated with a galaxy survey-based reconstruction of the remote dipole

          <p>We revisit several aspects of Standard Model physics at finite temperature
that drive the theoretical value of the cosmological parameter $N_{\rm eff}$,
the effective number of neutrinos in the early universe, away from 3. Our chief
focus is finite-temperature corrections to the equation of state of the QED
plasma in the vicinity of neutrino decoupling at $T \sim 1$ MeV, where $T$ is
the photon temperature. Working in the instantaneous decoupling approximation,
we recover at ${\cal O}(e^2)$, where $e$ is the elementary electric charge, the
well-established correction of $\delta N_{\rm eff}^{(2)} \simeq 0.010$ across a
range of plausible neutrino decoupling temperatures, in contrast to an
erroneous claim in the recent literature which found twice as large an effect.
At ${\cal O}(e^3)$ we find a new and significant correction of $\delta N_{\rm
eff}^{(3)} \simeq -0.001$ that has so far not been accounted for in any
precision calculation of $N_{\rm eff}$, significant because this correction is
potentially larger than the change in $N_{\rm eff}$ induced between including
and excluding neutrino oscillations in the transport modelling. In addition to
the QED equation of state, we make a first pass at quantifying
finite-temperature QED corrections to the weak interaction rates that directly
affect the neutrino decoupling process, and find that the ${\cal O}(e^2)$
thermal electron mass correction induces a change of $\delta N_{\rm
eff}^{m_{\rm th}} \lesssim 10^{-4}$. A complete assessment of the various
effects considered in this work on the final value of $N_{\rm eff}$ will
necessitate an account of neutrino energy transport beyond the instantaneous
decoupling approximation. However, relative to $N_{\rm eff} = 3.044$ obtained
in the most recent such calculation, we expect the new effects found in this
work to lower the number to $N_{\rm eff} = 3.043$.

          <p>We propose a new scheme to reconstruct the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO)
signal, which contains key cosmological information, based on deep
convolutional neural networks (CNN). Trained with almost no fine-tuning, the
network can recover large-scale modes accurately in the test set: the
correlation coefficient between the true and reconstructed initial conditions
reaches $90\%$ at $k\leq 0.2 h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, which can lead to significant
improvements of the BAO signal-to-noise ratio down to
$k\simeq0.4h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Since this new scheme is based on the
configuration-space density field in sub-boxes, it is local and less affected
by survey boundaries than the standard reconstruction method, as our tests
confirm. We find that the network trained in one cosmology is able to
reconstruct BAO peaks in the others, i.e. recovering information lost to
non-linearity independent of cosmology. The accuracy of recovered BAO peak
positions is far less than that caused by the difference in the cosmology
models for training and testing, suggesting that different models can be
distinguished efficiently in our scheme. It is very promising that Our scheme
provides a different new way to extract the cosmological information from the
ongoing and future large galaxy surveys.

methods, these allow spectra to be efficiently computed across a vast range of
scales, requiring orders of magnitude less computation time than Fast Fourier
Transform based approaches alone. These methods are applicable to any tracer;
simulation particles, halos or galaxies, and take advantage of the simple
geometry of the box and periodicity to remove almost all dependence on large
random particle catalogs. By working in configuration-space, both power spectra
and bispectra can be computed via a weighted sum of particle pairs up to some
radius, which can be reduced at larger $k$, leading to algorithms with
decreasing complexity on small scales. These do not suffer from aliasing or
shot-noise, allowing spectra to be computed to arbitrarily large wavenumbers.
The estimators are rigorously derived and tested against simulations, and their
covariances discussed. The accompanying code, HIPSTER, has been publicly
released, incorporating these algorithms. Such estimators will be of great use
in the analysis of large sets of high-resolution simulations.

          <p>Numerical simulations of massive neutrino cosmologies consistently find a
spoon-like feature in the non-linear matter power spectrum ratios of
cosmological models that differ only in the neutrino mass fraction f_N.
Typically, the ratio approaches unity at low wave numbers k, decreases by ~ 10
f_N at k ~ 1 h/Mpc, and turns up again at large k. Using the halo model of
large-scale structure, we show that this spoon feature originates in the
transition from the two-halo power spectrum to the one-halo power spectrum. The
former's sensitivity to f_N rises with k, while that of the latter decreases
with k. The presence of this spoon feature is robust with respect to different
choices of the halo mass function and the halo density profile, and does not
require any parameter tuning within the halo model. We demonstrate that a
standard halo model calculation is already able to predict the depth, width,
and position of this spoon as well as its evolution with redshift z with
remarkable accuracy. Predictions at z &gt;= 1 can be further improved using
non-linear perturbative inputs.

          <p>Measuring dark matter (DM) signals via electron recoil provides an important
means for direct detection of light DM particles. The recent XENON1T anomaly
with electron recoil energy around $\,E_R^{}\!=\!(2-3)$keV can be naturally
explained by DM inelastic scattering which injects energy to the recoiled
electrons and gives a narrow peak structure in the recoil spectrum. We present
an effective field theory (EFT) approach to exothermic inelastic DM signals for
the Xenon electron recoil detection. For relatively heavy mediator, we fairly
formulate the DM-lepton interactions by effective contact operators with two DM
fields $(X,\,X')$ and two leptons. Using the XENON1T data, we fit the electron
recoil spectrum and constrain the allowed scalar DM mass-splitting as
$\,2.1\,\text{keV}\!&lt;\!\Delta m\!&lt;\!3.3\,\text{keV}$ (95%C.L.), with the best
fit $\,\Delta m \!=\! 2.8$keV. We analyze the relic abundance produced by such
effective DM-electron contact interaction. To provide both the DM relic
abundance and the XENON1T excess, we derive new constraints on the DM mass and
the UV cutoff scale of DM effective interactions. Finally, we study possible UV

careful consideration of completeness corrections and galactic cuts, we obtain
a sample of $4.9\times 10^7$ galaxies covering 17 739 deg$^2$. We derive
photometric redshifts with precision $\sigma_z/(1+z)=0.012 - 0.015$, and
compare with alternative estimates. Cross-correlation of the tomographic galaxy
maps with Planck maps of CMB temperature and lensing convergence probe the
growth of structure since $z=0.8$. The signals are compared with a fiducial
Planck $\Lambda$CDM model, and require an overall scaling in amplitude of
$A_\kappa=0.901\pm 0.026$ for the lensing cross-correlation and $A_{\rm ISW} =
0.984 \pm 0.349$ for the temperature cross-correlation, interpreted as the
Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. The ISW amplitude is consistent with the
fiducial $\Lambda$CDM prediction, but lies significantly below the prediction
of the AvERA model of R\'acz et al. (2017), which has been proposed as an
alternative explanation for cosmic acceleration. Within $\Lambda$CDM, our low
amplitude for the lensing cross-correlation requires a reduction either in
fluctuation normalization or in matter density compared to the Planck results,
so that $\Omega_m^{0.78}\sigma_8=0.297\pm 0.009$. In combination with the total
amplitude of CMB lensing, this favours a shift mainly in density:
$\Omega_m=0.274\pm0.024$. We discuss the consistency of this figure with
alternative evidence. A conservative compromise between lensing and primary CMB
constraints would require $\Omega_m=0.296\pm0.006$, where the 95% confidence

          <p>One of the cornerstones of general relativity is the equivalence principle.
However, the validity of the equivalence principle has only been established on
solar system scales for standard matter fields; this result cannot be assumed
to hold for the non-standard matter fields that dominate the gravitational
dynamics on cosmological scales. Here we show how the equivalence principle may
be tested on cosmological scales for non-standard matter fields using the odd
multipoles of the galaxy cross-power spectrum and bispectrum. This test makes
use of the imprint on the galaxy cross-power spectrum and bispectrum by the
parity-violating general relativistic deformations of the past-light cone, and
assumes that galaxies can be treated as test particles that are made of baryons
and cold dark matter. This assumption leads to a non-zero galaxy-baryon
relative velocity if the equivalence principle does not hold between baryons
and dark matter. We show that the relative velocity can be constrained to be
less than 25% of the galaxy velocity using the cross-power spectrum of the HI
intensity mapping/Halpha galaxy survey and the bispectrum of the Halpha galaxy

combination of filters, CS are bright and easy to identify. We fit the CS
$J$-band luminosity functions using a Lorentzian distribution modified to allow
the distribution to be asymmetric. We use the parameters of the best-fit

resembles that of the LMC or SMC. Based on this resemblance, we use either the
LMC or SMC as the calibrator and estimate the distance to the given galaxy
using the median $J$ magnitude ($\overline{J}$) of the CS samples. We apply

          <p>Primordial black holes have been considered as an attractive dark matter
candidate, whereas some of the predictions heavily rely on the near-horizon
physics that remains to be tested experimentally. As a concrete alternative,
thermal 2-2-holes closely resemble black holes without event horizons. Being a
probable endpoint of gravitational collapse, they not only provide a resolution
to the information loss problem, but also naturally give rise to stable
remnants. Previously, we have considered primordial 2-2-hole remnants as dark
matter. Due to the strong constraints from a novel phenomenon associated with
remnant mergers, only small remnants with close to the Planck mass can
constitute all of dark matter. In this paper, we examine the scenario that the
majority of dark matter consists of particles produced by the evaporation of
primordial 2-2-holes, whereas the remnant contribution is secondary. The
products with light enough mass may contribute to the number of relativistic
degrees of freedom in the early universe, which we also calculate. Moreover,
2-2-hole evaporation can produce particles that are responsible for the baryon
asymmetry. We find that baryogenesis through direct B-violating decays or
through leptogenesis can both be realized. Overall, the viable parameter space
for the Planck remnant case is similar to primordial black holes with Planck
remnants. Heavier remnants, on the other hand, lead to different predictions,
and the viable parameter space remains large even when the remnant abundance is
constrained small.
