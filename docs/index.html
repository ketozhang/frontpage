          <p>Dark matter (DM) could be a relic of freeze-in through a light mediator,
where the DM is produced by extremely feeble, IR-dominated processes in the
thermal Standard Model plasma. In the simplest viable models with the DM mass
below the MeV scale, the DM has a small effective electric charge and is born
with a nonthermal phase-space distribution. This DM candidate would cause
observable departures from standard cosmological evolution. In this work, we
combine data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), Lyman-$\alpha$ forest,
quasar lensing, stellar streams, and Milky Way satellite abundances to set a
lower limit on freeze-in DM masses up to $\sim 20\,$keV, with the exact
constraint depending on whether the DM thermalizes in its own sector. We
perform forecasts for the CMB-S4 experiment, the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization
Array, and the Vera Rubin Observatory, finding that freeze-in DM masses up to
$\sim 80\,$keV can be explored. These cosmological probes are highly
complementary with proposed direct-detection efforts to search for this DM
candidate.

          <p>Radio halos are extended ($\sim{\rm Mpc}$), steep-spectrum sources found in
the central region of dynamically disturbed clusters of galaxies. Only a
handful of radio halos have been reported to reside in galaxy clusters with a
mass $M_{500}\lesssim5\times10^{14}\,M_\odot$. In this paper we present a LOFAR
144 MHz detection of a radio halo in the galaxy cluster Abell 990 with a mass
of $M_{500}=(4.9\pm0.3)\times10^{14}\,M_\odot$. The halo has a projected size
of $\sim$700$\,{\rm kpc}$ and a flux density of $20.2\pm2.2\,{\rm mJy}$ or a
radio power of $1.2\pm0.1\times10^{24}\,{\rm W\,Hz}^{-1}$ at the cluster
redshift ($z=0.144$) which makes it one of the two halos with the lowest radio
power detected to date. Our analysis of the emission from the cluster with
Chandra archival data using dynamical indicators shows that the cluster is not
undergoing a major merger but is a slightly disturbed system with a mean
temperature of $5\,{\rm keV}$. The low X-ray luminosity of
$L_{X}=(3.66\pm0.08)\times10^{44}\,{\rm ergs\,s}^{-1}$ in the 0.1--2.4 keV band
implies that the cluster is one of the least luminous systems known to host a
radio halo. Our detection of the radio halo in Abell 990 opens the possibility
of detecting many more halos in poorly-explored less-massive clusters with
low-frequency telescopes such as LOFAR, MWA (Phase II) and uGMRT.

          <p>The kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect is a secondary cosmic microwave
background (CMB) anisotropy induced by the scattering of CMB photons off
intervening electrons. Through cross-correlations with tracers of large-scale
structure, the kSZ effect can be used to reconstruct the 3-dimensional
radial-velocity field, a technique known as kSZ tomography. We explore the
cross-correlation between the CMB and line-intensity fluctuations to retrieve
the late-time kSZ signal across a wide redshift range. We focus on the CII
emission line, and predict the signal-to-noise ratio of the kSZ tomography
signal between redshifts $z=1-5$ for upcoming experiments. We show that while
instruments currently under construction may reach a low-significance detection
of kSZ tomography, next-generation experiments will achieve greater
sensitivity, with a detection significance of $\mathcal{O}(10^2-10^3)$. Due to
sample-variance cancellation, the cross-correlation between the reconstructed
velocity field from kSZ tomography and intensity fluctuations can improve
measurements of %the scale-dependent bias contributions from new physics to the
power spectrum at large scales. To illustrate this improvement, we consider
models of the early Universe that induce primordial local-type non-gaussianity
and correlated compensated isocurvature perturbations. We show that with CMB-S4
and an AtLAST-like survey, the uncertainty on $f_{\rm NL}$ and $A_{\rm CIP}$
can be reduced by a factor of $\sim 3$, achieving $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}) \lesssim
1$. We further show that probing both low and high redshifts is crucial to
break the degeneracy between the two parameters.

          <p>We present the source associations, cross-identifications, and
multi-wavelength properties of the faint radio source population detected in
the deep tier of the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS): the LoTSS Deep Fields.
The first LoTSS Deep Fields data release consists of deep radio imaging at
150~MHz of the ELAIS-N1, Lockman Hole, and Bo\"{o}tes fields, down to RMS
sensitives of around 20, 22, and 32$~\mu$Jy\,beam$^{-1}$, respectively. These
fields are some of the best studied extra-galactic fields in the northern sky,
with existing deep, wide-area panchromatic photometry from X-ray to infrared
wavelengths, covering a total of $\approx$~26~\mbox{deg$^{2}$}. We first
generated improved multi-wavelength catalogues in ELAIS-N1 and Lockman Hole;
combined with the existing catalogue for Bo\"{o}tes, we present forced, matched
aperture photometry for over 7.2 million sources across the three fields. We
identified multi-wavelength counterparts to the radio detected sources, using a
combination of the Likelihood Ratio method and visual classification, which
greatly enhances the scientific potential of radio surveys and allows for the
characterisation of the photometric redshifts and the physical properties of
the host galaxies. The final radio-optical cross-matched catalogue consists of
81\,951 radio-detected sources, with counterparts identified and
multi-wavelength properties presented for 79\,820 ($&gt;$97\%) sources. We also
examine the properties of the host galaxies, and through stacking analysis find
that the radio population with no identified counterpart is likely dominated by
AGN at $z\sim3-4$. This dataset contains one of the largest samples of
radio-selected star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) at these
depths, making it ideal for studying the history of star-formation, and the
evolution of galaxies and AGN across cosmic time.

          <p>Some million Type Ia supernovae (SN) will be discovered and monitored during
upcoming wide area time domain surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory
Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). For cosmological use, accurate
redshifts are needed among other characteristics; however the vast majority of
the SN will not have spectroscopic redshifts, even for their host galaxies,
only photometric redshifts. We assess the redshift systematic control necessary
for robust cosmology. Based on the photometric vs true redshift relation
generated by machine learning applied to a simulation of 500,000 galaxies as
observed with LSST quality, we quantify requirements on systematics in the mean
relation and in the outlier fraction and deviance so as not to bias dark energy
cosmological inference. Certain redshift ranges are particularly sensitive,
motivating spectroscopic followup of SN at $z\lesssim0.2$ and around
$z\approx0.5$-0.6. Including Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope near infrared
bands in the simulation, we reanalyze the constraints, finding improvements at
high redshift but little at the low redshifts where systematics lead to strong
cosmology bias. We identify a complete spectroscopic survey of SN host galaxies
for $z\lesssim0.2$ as a highly favored element for robust SN cosmology.

          <p>Aims: We investigate the orbital and phase space properties of loss cone
stars that interact strongly with a hard, high-redshift binary supermassive
black hole (SMBH) system formed in a cosmological scenario. Methods: We utilize
a novel hybrid integration approach that combines the direct N-body code
$\varphi$-GRAPE, with ETICS, a collisionless code that employs the
self-consistent field integration method. The hybrid approach shows
considerable speed-up over direct summation for particle numbers $&gt; 10^6$,
while retaining accuracy of direct N-body for a subset of particles. During the
SMBH binary evolution we monitor individual stellar interactions with the
binary in order to identify stars that noticeably contribute to the SMBH binary
hardening. Results: We successfully identify and analyze in detail the
properties of stars which extract energy from the binary. We identify stars on
centrophilic orbits that repopulate the loss cone and estimate that $76\%$ of
the centrophilic orbits are possible only in a triaxial system. We distinguish
three different populations of interactions, based on their apocenter and
investigate their contribution to the SMBH binary hardening. We find a clear
prevalence of interactions co-rotating with the binary. While smaller in
number, retrograde interactions are the most energetic, contributing only
slightly less than the prograde population to the overall energy exchange. The
most energetic interactions are also likely to result in a sign-flip change in
the angular momentum of the star. We show that even slight triaxiality results
in a roughly constant hardening rate of the binary, avoiding the Final Parsec
Problem. We estimate the merger timescale of the binary to be $\approx 20$
$\mathrm{Myr}$, a value larger by a factor of two than the timescale reported
in a previous study.

the sources and IGM properties of the process of reionization using the number

extracted from realistic mock observations. To do so, we extend the Markov

demonstrate that the evolution of the number-count and morphology of the
ionized regions as a function of redshift provides independent information to
disentangle multiple reionization scenarios because it probes the average
ionizing budget per baryon. Although less precise, we find that constraints
inferred using 21-cm tomographic statistics are more robust to the presence of

lensing effect it has on the images of far away galaxies. By measuring this
lensing effect on a large number of galaxies it is possible to reconstruct maps
of the Dark Matter distribution on the sky. This, however, represents an
extremely challenging inverse problem due to missing data and noise dominated

point of considerable interest, with some lines of argument pointing to an
entirely new cosmological synchrotron background. The contribution of the known
discrete source population to the sky temperature is key to this discussion.
Because of the steep spectral index of the excess over the cosmic microwave
background, it is best studied at low frequencies where the signal is
strongest. The Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) wide and deep sky surveys give us
the best constraints yet on the contribution of discrete extragalactic sources
at 144 MHz, and in particular allow us to include contributions from diffuse,
low-surface-brightness emission that could not be fully accounted for in
previous work. We show that, even with these new data, known sources can still
only account for around a quarter of the estimated extragalactic sky

scaling solutions are unstable fixed points and, therefore, the system exits
these solutions toward attractors points describing the dark energy dominated
era at the current epoch of cosmic acceleration.

          <p>The CMB dipole is usually assumed to be completely due to the relative
velocity between the solar system and the CMB restframe. We test this
hypothesis by measuring independently the Doppler and aberration effects on the
CMB using Planck 2018 data. We remove the contributions arising solely from the
conversion of intensity into temperature and arrive at measurements which are
independent from the CMB dipole itself. Doppler and aberration are measured
independently in the TT and EE maps for both SMICA and NILC. Combining these
new measurements with the dipole one we get the first constraints on the
intrinsic CMB dipole. Neglecting a dipolar lensing contribution we can put an
upper limit on its amplitude: 3.5 mK (95% CI). We also obtain the estimate of
the peculiar velocity of the solar system which does not assume a negligible
intrinsic dipole contribution: $v = (300 \pm 99)$ km/s with $(l,b) = (276 \pm
32, 51 \pm 19)^\circ$ [SMICA] and $v = (300 \pm 100)$ km/s with $(l,b) = (280
\pm 32, 50 \pm 20)^\circ$ [NILC] with negligible systematic contributions.
These values are consistent with the peculiar velocity hypothesis of the
dipole.

          <p>Using magnetohydrodynamic simulations of fluctuation dynamos, we perform
broad-bandwidth synthetic observations to investigate the properties of
polarized synchrotron emission and the role Faraday rotation plays in inferring
the polarized structures in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters.
In the saturated state of the dynamo, we find a Faraday depth (FD) dispersion
$\sigma_{\rm FD} \approx 100$ rad m$^{-2}$, in agreement with observed values
in the ICM. Remarkably, the FD power spectrum is qualitatively similar to
$M(k)/k$, where $M(k)$ is the magnetic spectrum and $k$ the wavenumber.
However, this similarity is broken at high $k$ when FD is obtained by applying
RM synthesis to polarized emission from the ICM due to poor resolution and
complexities of spectrum in FD space. Unlike the Gaussian probability
distribution function (PDF) obtained for FD, the PDF of the synchrotron
intensity is log-normal. Relatively large $\sigma_{\rm FD}$ in the ICM gives
rise to strong frequency-dependent variations of the pixel-wise mean and peak
polarized intensities at low frequencies ($\lesssim 1.5\,{\rm GHz}$). The mean
fractional polarization $\langle p \rangle$ obtained at the resolution of the
simulations increases from $&lt;0.1$ at 0.5 GHz to its intrinsic value of
$\sim0.3$ at 6 GHz. Beam smoothing significantly affects the polarization
properties below $\lesssim 1.5\,{\rm GHz}$, reducing $\langle p \rangle$ to
$\sim 0.01$ at 0.5 GHz. At frequencies $\gtrsim 5\,{\rm GHz}$, polarization
remains largely unaffected, even when recovered using RM synthesis. Thus, our
results underline the need for high frequency ($\gtrsim 5\,{\rm GHz}$)
observations with future radio telescopes to effectively probe the properties
of polarized emission in the ICM.

          <p>We constrain polarized foreground emission between 30 and 70GHz with the
Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) and WMAP data within the framework of
BeyondPlanck global Bayesian analysis. We combine for the first time
full-resolution Planck LFI time-ordered data with low-resolution WMAP sky maps
at 33, 40 and 61GHz. Spectral parameters are fit with a likelihood defined at
the native resolution of each frequency channel. This analysis represents the
first implementation of true multi-resolution component separation applied to
CMB observations for both amplitude and spectral energy distribution (SED)
parameters. For synchrotron emission, we approximate the SED as a power-law in
frequency and find that the low signal-to-noise ratio of the data set strongly
limits the number of free parameters that may be robustly constrained. We
partition the sky into four large disjoint regions (High Latitude; Galactic
Spur; Galactic Plane; and Galactic Center), each associated with its own
power-law index. We find that the High Latitude region is prior-dominated,
while the Galactic Center region is contaminated by residual instrumental
systematics. The two remaining regions appear to be both signal-dominated and
clean of systematics, and for these we derive spectral indices of
$\beta_{\mathrm s}^{\mathrm{Spur}}=-3.15\pm0.07$ and $\beta_{\mathrm
s}^{\mathrm{Plane}}=-3.12\pm0.06$. This agrees qualitatively with the WMAP-only
polarization constraints presented by Dunkley et al. (2009), but contrasts with
several temperature-based analyses. For thermal dust emission we assume a
modified blackbody model and we fit the power-law index across the full sky. We
find $\beta_{\mathrm{d}}=1.62\pm0.04$, which is slightly steeper than that
previously reported from Planck HFI data, but still statistically consistent at

          <p>We investigate the dispersion measure(DM) and scattering of FRBs by the
intergalactic-medium(IGM), foreground and host halos, using cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation. We find that the median DM caused by foreground
halos is around 30\% of that caused by the IGM, but has a much larger variance.
The DM induced by hosts deviates from a log-normal distribution, but exhibits
an extended distribution in the range of $1-3000 \ {\rm{pc\, cm^{-3}}}$ with a
median value $\sim 100 \ {\rm{pc\, cm^{-3}}}$. Then we produce mock FRB
sources, assuming a uniform distribution in the range $z\sim 0-0.82$, to
consider the propagation effect of IGM, foreground and host halos on FRB
signals simultaneously. The DM distribution of mock sources agrees well with
the observation. The fitted DM-redshift relation of the mock sources can
provide a rough estimation of the redshifts of observed events with errors
$\delta z \lesssim 0.15$. The distribution of mock sources in the DM-scattering
time($\tau$) space can also match the observation, assuming a Kolmogorov
turbulence model with the inner and outer scale is 1000 km to 1 AU, and 0.2-10
pc respectively. Finally, we estimate the relative importance of these medium
on DM and $\tau$ in our models. The IGM and host halos are the primary and
secondary sources to the extragalactic DM, $\rm{DM_{exg}}$. Meanwhile, the
contribution from foreground halos increases as $\rm{DM_{exg}}$ increases. The
host and foreground halos may be the most important medium for scattering.
Statistically, the latter may dominate the scattering of events with

          <p>Dust properties within a galaxy are known to change from the diffuse medium
to dense clouds due to increased local gas density. However, the question of
whether dust properties change with redshift remains elusive. In this paper,
using the fact that the mean radiation intensity of the interstellar medium
(ISM) of star-forming galaxies increases with redshift, we show that dust
properties should change due to increasing efficiency of rotational disruption
by radiative torques, an effect named RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD). We
first show that, due to RATD, the size distribution of interstellar dust varies
with redshift, such as dust grains become smaller at higher $z$. We model the
extinction curves and find that the curve becomes steeper with increasing
redshift. The ratio of total-to-selective extinction, $R_{V}$, decreases with
redshift and achieves low values of $R_{V}\sim 1.5-2.5$ for grains having a
composite structure. We also find that dust properties change with the local
gas density due to RATD, but the change is dominated by the radiation field for
the diffuse ISM. The low values of $R_{V}$ implied by RATD of interstellar dust
could reproduce anomalous dust extinction observed toward type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)-like extinction curves with a steep
far-UV rise toward high-z galaxies. Fluctuations in $R_{V}$ due to interstellar
turbulence and varying radiation intensity may resolve the tension in
measurements of the Hubble constant using SNe Ia. We finally discuss the
implications of evolving dust properties for high-z astrophysics.

          <p>Assuming that a scalar field controls the inflationary era, we examine the
combined effects of string and $f(R)$ gravity corrections on the inflationary
dynamics of canonical scalar field inflation, imposing the constraint that the
speed of the primordial gravitational waves is equal to that of light's.
Particularly, we study the inflationary dynamics of an Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet
gravity in the presence of $\alpha R^2$ corrections, where $\alpha$ is a free
coupling parameter. As it was the case in the pure Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet
gravity, the realization that the gravitational waves propagate through
spacetime with the velocity of light, imposes the constraint that the
Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $\xi(\phi)$ obeys the differential equation
$\ddot\xi=H\dot\xi$, where $H$ is the Hubble rate. Subsequently, a relation for
the time derivative of the scalar field is extracted which implies that the
scalar functions of the model, which are the Gauss-Bonnet coupling and the
scalar potential, are interconnected and simply designating one of them
specifies the other immediately. In this framework, it is useful to freely
designate $\xi(\phi)$ and extract the corresponding scalar potential from the
equations of motion but the opposite is still feasible. We demonstrate that the
model can produce a viable inflationary phenomenology and for a wide range of
the free parameters. Also, a mentionable issue is that when the coupling
parameter $\alpha$ of the $R^2$ correction term is $\alpha&lt;10^{-3}$ in Planck
Units, the $R^2$ term is practically negligible and one obtains the same
equations of motion as in the pure Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, however the
dynamics still change, since now the time derivative of $\frac{\partial
f}{\partial R}$ is nonzero.

which the whole northern radio sky will be observed at 150 MHz with a
sensitivity better than 100 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at a resolution of 6".
Additionally, deeper observations are planned to cover smaller areas with
higher sensitivity. The Lockman Hole, the Bo\"otes and the Elais-N1 regions are
among the most well known northern extra-galactic fields, and the deepest of
the LoTSS Deep Fields so far. We exploit these deep observations to derive the
deepest radio source counts at 150 MHz to date. Our counts are in broad
agreement with those from the literature, and show the well known upturn at
$\leq$ few mJy, mainly associated with the emergence of the star-forming galaxy
population. More interestingly, our counts show for the first time a very
pronounced drop around S$\sim$2 mJy, which results in a prominent `bump' at
sub-mJy flux densities. Such a feature was not observed in previous counts'
determinations (neither at 150 MHz nor at higher frequency), and we believe
this is the result of a careful analysis aimed at deblending confused sources
and removing spurious sources and artifacts from the radio catalogues. This
bump cannot be reproduced by any of the existing state-of-the-art evolutionary

correlation of dark matter halo properties with the large-scale environment. We

walls, filaments, and nodes. For the first time we present a study of CW
effects for halos covering six decades in mass: $10^{8}-10^{14}{h^{-1}{\rm
M}_{\odot}}$. We find that the fraction of halos living in various web
components is a strong function of mass, with the majority of
$M&gt;10^{12}{h^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}}$ halos living in filaments and nodes. Low
mass halos are more equitably distributed in filaments, walls, and voids. For
halo density profiles and formation times we find a universal mass threshold of
$M_{th}\sim6\times10^{10}{h^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}}$ below which these properties
vary with environment. Here, filament halos have the steepest
concentration-mass relation, walls are close to the overall mean, and void
halos have the flattest relation. This amounts to $c_{200}$ for filament and
void halos that are respectively $14\%$ higher and $7\%$ lower than the mean at
$M=2\times10^8{h^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}}$, with low-mass node halos are most
likely splashed-back. We find double power-law fits that very well describe
$c(M)$ for the four environments in the whole probed mass range. A
complementary picture is found for the average formation times, with the
mass-formation time relations following trends shown for the concentrations:
the nodes halos being the oldest and void halo the youngest. The CW
environmental effect is much weaker when studying the halo spin and shapes. The
trends with halo mass is reversed: the small halos with $M&lt;10^{10}{h^{-1}{\rm

visible for more massive void and walls halos, which, on average, are
characterized by lower spin and higher triaxiality parameters.

          <p>The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is gravitationally lensed by
large-scale structure, which distorts observations of the primordial
anisotropies in any given direction. Averaged over the sky, this important
effect is routinely modelled with via the lensed CMB power spectra. This
accounts for the variance of this distortion, where the leading variance effect
is quadratic in the lensing deflections. However, we show that if bright
extragalactic sources correlated with the large-scale structure are masked in a
CMB map, the power spectrum measured over the unmasked area using a standard
pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimator has an additional linear lensing effect arising from
correlations between the masked area and the lensing. This induces a
scale-dependent average demagnification of the unlensed distance between
unmasked pairs of observed points and a negative contribution to the CMB
correlation function peaking at $\sim 10$ arcmin. We give simple analytic
models for point sources and a threshold mask constructed on a correlated
Gaussian foreground field. We demonstrate the consistency of their predictions
for masks removing radio sources and peaks of Sunyaev-Zeldovich and cosmic
infrared background emissions using realistic numerical simulations. We discuss
simple diagnostics that can be used to test for the effect in the absence of a
good model for the masked sources and show that by constructing specific masks
the effect can be observed on Planck data. For masks employed in the analysis
of Planck and other current data sets, the effect is likely to be negligible,

substantial populations of resolved sources are masked.

          <p>Risaliti, Lusso \&amp; collaborators have constructed a high-redshift Hubble
diagram of supernovae (SNe), quasars (QSO) and gamma-ray bursts (GRB) that
shows a "$\sim 4 \, \sigma$ tension with the $\Lambda$CDM model" based on a log
polynomial cosmographic expansion \cite{Risaliti:2018reu, Lusso:2019akb}. In
this work, we demonstrate that the log polynomial expansion generically fails
to recover flat $\Lambda$CDM beyond $z \sim 2$, thus undermining the $\sim 4 \,
\sigma$ tension claim. Moreover, through direct fits of both the flat
$\Lambda$CDM and the log polynomial model to the SNe+QSO+GRB dataset, we
confirm that the flat $\Lambda$CDM model is preferred. Ultimately, we trace the
tension to the QSO data and show that a best-fit of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model
to the QSO data leads to a flat $\Lambda$CDM Universe with no dark energy
within $1 \, \sigma$. This marks an irreconcilable tension between the
Risaliti-Lusso QSOs and flat $\Lambda$CDM.

          <p>The spontaneous breaking of U(1)_B-L around the scale of grand unification
can simultaneously account for hybrid inflation, leptogenesis, and neutralino
dark matter, thus resolving three major puzzles of particle physics and
cosmology in a single predictive framework. The B-L phase transition also
results in a network of cosmic strings. If strong and electroweak interactions
are unified in an SO(10) gauge group, containing U(1)_B-L as a subgroup, these
strings are metastable. In this case, they produce a stochastic background of
gravitational waves that evades current pulsar timing bounds, but features a
flat spectrum with amplitude h^2\Omega_GW ~ 10^-8 at interferometer

          <p>For a scalar field $\phi$ coupled to cold dark matter (CDM), we provide a
general framework for studying the background and perturbation dynamics on the
isotropic cosmological background. The dark energy sector is described by a
Horndeski Lagrangian with the speed of gravitational waves equivalent to that
of light, whereas CDM is dealt as a perfect fluid characterized by the number
density $n_c$ and four-velocity $u_c^\mu$. For a very general interacting
Lagrangian $f(n_c, \phi, X, Z)$, where $f$ depends on $n_c$, $\phi$,
$X=-\partial^{\mu} \phi \partial_{\mu} \phi/2$, and $Z=u_c^{\mu} \partial_{\mu}
\phi$, we derive the full linear perturbation equations of motion without
fixing any gauge conditions. To realize a vanishing CDM sound speed for the
successful structure formation, the interacting function needs to be of the
form $f=-f_1(\phi, X, Z)n_c+f_2(\phi, X, Z)$. Employing a quasi-static
approximation for the modes deep inside the sound horizon, we obtain analytic
formulas for the effective gravitational couplings of CDM and baryon density
perturbations as well as gravitational and weak lensing potentials. We apply
our general formulas to several interacting theories and show that, in many
cases, the CDM gravitational coupling around the quasi de-Sitter background can
be smaller than the Newton constant $G$ due to a momentum transfer induced by
the $Z$-dependence in $f_2$.

          <p>Modelling the anisotropies in the CIB on all the scales is a challenging task
due to the complex nature of the galaxy evolution and thus often requires too
many parameters in order to fit the observational data. In this paper, we
present a new halo model for the anisotropies of the CIB using only four
parameters. Our model connects the mass accretion on the dark matter halos to
the star formation rate. Using this model, we find that the halo mass with the
maximum efficiency for converting the accreted baryons into stars is
$\log_{10}M_\mathrm{max} = {12.94}^{+0.02}_{-0.02} \: M_\odot$, consistent with
other studies. Accounting for the mass loss through stellar evolution, we find,
for an intermediate age galaxy, that the star formation efficiency defined as
$M_\star(z)/M_b(z)$ is equal to 0.19 and 0.21 at redshift 0.1 and 2
respectively, in good agreement with the values obtained by previous studies.
It is the first time that a CIB model is used to fit Planck and Herschel CIB
power spectra simultaneously. However we find that the large angular scale
Planck and Herschel data are not fully compatible with the small scale Herschel
data (for $\ell&gt;3000$). The CIB is expected to be correlated with the tSZ
signal of the galaxy clusters. Using this halo model for the CIB, and a halo
model for the tSZ with a single parameter, we also provide a consistent
framework to calculate this cross-correlation, which requires no extra
parameter. The CIB$\times$tSZ correlation is found to be higher when inferred
with a combination of two widely spaced frequency channels (e.g. 143x857 GHz).
The CIB, tSZ, and CIB$\times$tSZ act as foregrounds while measuring the kSZ
power spectrum from the CMB power spectrum and need to be removed. Due to its
simplistic nature and low number of parameters, the halo model formalism
presented here is quite useful for such an analysis to measure the kSZ power
spectrum accurately.

expected sensitivity to spin-independent WIMP-nucleon interactions reaches a
cross-section of $1.4\times10^{-48}$ cm$^2$ for a 50 GeV/c$^2$ mass WIMP at 90%

the median XENONnT discovery significance exceeds 3$\sigma$ (5$\sigma$). The

          <p>Inaccuracies in the initial conditions for cosmological N-body simulations
could easily be the largest source of systematic error in predicting the
non-linear large-scale structure. From the theory side, initial conditions are
usually provided by using low-order truncations of the displacement field from
Lagrangian perturbation theory, with the first and second-order approximations
being the most common ones. Here we investigate the improvement brought by
using initial conditions based on third-order Lagrangian perturbation theory
(3LPT). We show that with 3LPT, truncation errors are vastly suppressed,
thereby opening the portal to initializing simulations accurately as late as
z=12 (for the resolution we consider). We analyse the competing effects of
perturbative truncation and particle discreteness on various summary
statistics. Discreteness errors are essentially decaying modes and thus get
strongly amplified for earlier initialization times. We show that late starting
times with 3LPT provide the most accurate configuration, which we find to
coincide with the continuum fluid limit within 1 per cent for the power- and
bispectrum at z=0 up to the particle Nyquist wave number of our simulations (k
~ 3h/Mpc). In conclusion, to suppress non-fluid artefacts, we recommend
initializing simulations as late as possible with 3LPT. We make our 3LPT

          <p>Dark matter phenomena in rotationally supported galaxies exhibit a
characteristic acceleration scale of $g_\dagger \approx 1.2\times 10^{-10}$ m
s$^{-2}$. Whether this acceleration is a manifestation of a universal scale, or
merely an emergent property with an intrinsic scatter, has been debated in the
literature. Here we investigate whether a universal acceleration scale exists
in dispersion-supported galaxies using two uniform sets of integral field
spectroscopy (IFS) data from SDSS-IV MaNGA and ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$. We apply the
spherical Jeans equation to 15 MaNGA and 4 ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ slow-rotator E0
(i.e., nearly spherical) galaxies. Velocity dispersion profiles for these
galaxies are well determined with observational errors under control. Bayesian
inference indicates that all 19 galaxies are consistent with a universal
acceleration of $g_\dagger=1.5_{-0.6}^{+0.9}\times 10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$.
Moreover, all 387 data points from the radial bins of the velocity dispersion
profiles are consistent with a universal relation between the radial
acceleration traced by dynamics and that predicted by the observed distribution
of baryons. This universality remains if we include 12 additional non-E0
slow-rotator elliptical galaxies from ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$. Finally, the universal
acceleration from MaNGA and ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ is consistent with that for
rotationally supported galaxies, so our results support the view that dark
matter phenomenology in galaxies involves a universal acceleration scale.

the expressions for the time-domain waveforms of the four polarizations. With
the stationary phase approximations, we obtain the Fourier transforms of the
two tensor polarizations. We find that when the scalar field is light, the
waveforms can be mapped to the parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE) framework
and we identify the ppE parameters. However, when the scalar field is heavy,
the ppE framework is not applicable. We also obtain the projected constraints
on the parameters of this theory by gravitational wave observations of future
ground-based detectors. Finally, we apply our result to the model proposed by
Damour and Esposito-Far\`{e}se, $f(R)$ gravity, and screened modified gravity.
