          <p>We present optical follow-up observations for candidate clusters in the
Clusters Hiding in Plain Sight (CHiPS) survey, which is designed to find new
galaxy clusters with extreme central galaxies that were misidentified as bright
isolated sources in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey catalog. We identify 11 cluster
candidates around X-ray, radio, and mid-IR bright sources, including six
well-known clusters, two false associations of foreground and background
clusters, and three new candidates which are observed further with Chandra. Of
the three new candidates, we confirm two newly discovered galaxy clusters:
CHIPS1356-3421 and CHIPS1911+4455. Both clusters are luminous enough to be
detected in the ROSAT All Sky-Survey data if not because of their bright
central cores. CHIPS1911+4455 is similar in many ways to the Phoenix cluster,
but with a highly-disturbed X-ray morphology on large scales. We find the
occurrence rate for clusters that would appear to be X-ray bright point sources
in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (and any surveys with similar angular resolution)
to be 2+/-1%, and the occurrence rate of clusters with runaway cooling in their
cores to be &lt;1%, consistent with predictions of Chaotic Cold Accretion. With
the number of new groups and clusters predicted to be found with eROSITA, the
population of clusters that appear to be point sources (due to a central QSO or
a dense cool core) could be around 2000. Finally, this survey demonstrates that
the Phoenix cluster is likely the strongest cool core at z&lt;0.7 -- anything more
extreme would have been found in this survey.

          <p>We analyse the gas content evolution of infalling haloes in cluster
environments from THE THREE HUNDRED project, a collection of 324 numerically
modelled galaxy clusters. The haloes in our sample were selected within
$5R_{200}$ of the main cluster halo at $z=0$ and have total halo mass
$M_{200}\geq10^{11} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$. We track their main progenitors and
study their gas evolution since their crossing into the infall region, which we
define as $1-4R_{200}$. Studying the radial trends of our populations using
both the full phase space information and a line-of-sight projection, we
confirm the Arthur et al. (2019) result and identify a characteristic radius
around $1.7R_{200}$ in 3D and at $R_{200}$ in projection at which infalling
haloes lose nearly all of the gas prior their infall. Splitting the trends by
subhalo status we show that subhaloes residing in group-mass and low-mass host
haloes in the infall region follow similar radial gas-loss trends as their
hosts, whereas subhaloes of cluster-mass host haloes are stripped of their gas
much further out. Our results show that infalling objects suffer significant
gaseous disruption that correlates with time-since-infall, cluster-centric
distance and host mass, and that the gaseous disruption they experience is a
combination of subhalo pre-processing and object gas depletion at a radius
which behaves like an accretion shock.

          <p>We report the discovery of an intrinsically faint, quintuply-imaged, dusty
galaxy MACS0600-z6 at a redshift $z=$6.07 viewed through the cluster
MACSJ0600.1-2008 ($z$=0.46). A $\simeq4\sigma$ dust detection is seen at 1.2mm
as part of the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS), an on-going ALMA Large
program, and the redshift is secured via [C II] 158 $\mu$m emission described
in a companion paper. In addition, spectroscopic follow-up with
GMOS/Gemini-North shows a break in the galaxy's spectrum, consistent with the
Lyman break at that redshift. We use a detailed mass model of the cluster and
infer a magnification $\mu\gtrsim$30 for the most magnified image of this
galaxy, which provides an unprecedented opportunity to probe the physical
properties of a sub-luminous galaxy at the end of cosmic reionisation. Based on
the spectral energy distribution, we infer lensing-corrected stellar and dust
masses of $\rm{2.9^{+11.5}_{-2.3}\times10^9}$ and
$\rm{4.8^{+4.5}_{-3.4}\times10^6}$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ respectively, a star
formation rate of $\rm{9.7^{+22.0}_{-6.6} M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}$, an intrinsic
size of $\rm{0.54^{+0.26}_{-0.14}}$ kpc, and a luminosity-weighted age of
200$\pm$100 Myr. Strikingly, the dust production rate in this relatively young
galaxy appears to be larger than that observed for equivalent, lower redshift
sources. We discuss if this implies that early supernovae are more efficient
dust producers and the consequences for using dust mass as a probe of earlier
star formation.

          <p>We present the evolution of the 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn and the epoch
of reionization (EoR) in an upgraded model including three subtle effects of
Ly-a radiation: Ly-a heating, CMB heating (mediated by Ly-a photons), and
multiple scattering of Ly-a photons. Taking these effects into account we
explore a wide range of astrophysical models and quantify the impact of these
processes on the global 21-cm signal and its power spectrum at observable
scales and redshifts. We find that, in agreement with the literature, Ly-a and
CMB heating raise the gas temperature by up to $\mathcal{O}(100)$ degrees in
models with weak X-ray heating and, thus, suppress the predicted 21-cm signals.
Varying the astrophysical parameters over broad ranges, we find that in the
upgraded model the absorption trough of the global signal reaches a lowest
floor of $-165$ mK at redshifts $z\approx 15-19$. This is in contrast with the
predictions for a pure adiabatically cooling Universe, for which the deepest
possible absorption is a monotonically decreasing function of cosmic time and
is $-178$ mK at $z = 19$ and $-216$ mK at $z=15$, dropping to even lower values
at lower redshifts (e.g. $-264$ mK at $z = 10$). With the Ly-a and CMB heating
included we also observe a strong suppression in the low-redshift power
spectra, with the maximum possible power (evaluated over the ensemble of
models) attenuated by a factor of $6.6$ at $z=9$ and $k = 0.1$ Mpc$^{-1}$.
Finally, we find that at high redshifts corresponding to cosmic dawn, the
heating terms have a subdominant effect while multiple scattering of Ly-a
photons is important, leading to an amplification of the power spectrum by a
factor of $\sim 2-5$.

          <p>Processes of particle production during inflation can increase the amplitude
of the scalar metric perturbations. We show that such a mechanism can naturally
arise in supergravity models where an axion-like field, whose potential is
generated by monodromy, drives large field inflation. In this class of models
one generally expects instanton-like corrections to the superpotential. We
show, by deriving the equations of motion in models of supergravity with a
stabilizer, that such corrections generate an interaction between the inflaton
and its superpartner. This inflaton-inflatino interaction term is rapidly
oscillating, and can lead to copious production of fermions during inflation,
filling the Fermi sphere up to momenta much larger than the Hubble parameter.
In their turn, those fermions source inflaton fluctuations, increasing their
amplitude, and effectively lowering the tensor-to-scalar ratio for the model,
as discussed in [1, 2]. This allows, in particular, to bring the model where
the inflaton potential is quadratic (plus negligibly small instanton
corrections) to agree with all existing observations.

          <p>While the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM, agrees well with a host
of cosmological data on large scales, a number of contentious small-scale
tensions and the unknown physical (e.g. particle) nature of dark matter
motivate the exploration of alternative scenarios. An ultra-light bosonic
particle of mass in the range $\approx 10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^2$ is of special
interest, as it both has particle physics motivations, and may give rise to
notable differences in the structures on highly non-linear scales due to the
manifestation of quantum-physical wave effects on macroscopic scales. Using a
spectral technique, we here discuss simulations of such fuzzy dark matter (FDM)
with a comparatively large dynamic range and for larger box sizes than
considered previously. We focus on the evolution of the matter power spectrum,
and give first results for the FDM halo mass function directly based on FDM
simulations. Unlike in $\Lambda$CDM, it is computationally challenging to
accurately treat the growth on large scales in FDM, even in the regime where
this follows linear theory. Once sufficient numerical resolution is available,
FDM shows a pronounced suppression of power on small scales relative to cold
dark matter (CDM), which can be understood as a damping effect due to 'quantum
pressure'. In certain regimes, however, the FDM power can exceed that of CDM,
which may be interpreted as a reflection of order-unity density fluctuations
occurring in FDM. The halo mass functions are identical for massive haloes, but
FDM shows a significant abundance reduction below a characteristic mass scale.
This could in principle alleviate the need to invoke very strong feedback
processes in small galaxies to reconcile $\Lambda$CDM with the observed galaxy
luminosity function, but detailed studies that also include baryons will be
needed to ultimately judge the viability of FDM.

GHz at $\geq$ 8$\sigma$ exactly at positions of two multiple images of the LBG
behind the massive galaxy cluster RXCJ0600$-$2007. Our lens models, updated
with the latest spectroscopy from VLT/MUSE, indicate that a sub region of the
LBG crosses the caustic and is lensed into a long ($\sim6''$) arc with a local
magnification of $\mu\sim 160$, for which the [CII] line is also significantly
detected. The source-plane reconstruction resolves the interstellar medium
(ISM) structure, showing that the [CII] line is co-spatial with the rest-frame
UV continuum at the scale of $\sim$300 pc. The [CII] line properties suggest
that the LBG is a rotation-dominated system whose velocity gradient explains a
slight difference of redshifts between the whole LBG and its sub region. The
star formation rate (SFR)-$L_{\rm [CII]}$ relations from the sub to the whole
regions of the LBG are consistent with those of local galaxies. We evaluate the
lower limit of the faint-end of the [CII] luminosity function at $z=6$, and
find that it is consistent with predictions from semi analytical models and
from the local SFR-$L_{\rm [CII]}$ relation with a SFR function at $z=6$. These
results imply that the local SFR-$L_{\rm [CII]}$ relation is universal for a
wide range of scales including the spatially resolved ISM, the whole region of

doublet with appropriate $B-L$ charge can allow heavy fermion coupling with the
SM leptons so that out of equilibrium decay of the former can lead to
generation of lepton asymmetry. Due to the $B-L$ gauge interactions of the
decaying fermion, the criteria of successful Dirac leptogenesis can also
constrain the gauge sector couplings so as to keep the corresponding washout
processes under control. The same $B-L$ gauge sector parameter space can also
be constrained from dark matter requirements if the latter is assumed to be a
SM singlet particle with non-zero $B-L$ charge. The same $B-L$ gauge
interactions also lead to additional thermalised relativistic degrees of

constrained by Planck 2018 data. While there exists parameter space from the

          <p>In this article we compare a variety of well known dynamical dark energy
models using the cosmic microwave background measurements from the 2018 Planck
legacy and 2015 Planck data releases, the baryon acoustic oscillations
measurements and the local measurements of $H_0$ obtained by the SH0ES

analysing the Hubble Space Telescope data. We discuss the alleviation of $H_0$
tension, that is obtained at the price of a phantom-like dark energy equation
of state. We perform a Bayesian evidence analysis to quantify the improvement
of the fit, finding that all the dark energy models considered in this work are
preferred against the $\Lambda$CDM scenario. Finally, among all the
possibilities analyzed, the CPL model is the best one in fitting the data and
solving the $H_0$ tension at the same time. However, unfortunately, this
dynamical dark energy solution is not supported by the baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAO) data, and the tension is restored when BAO data are included
for all the models.

          <p>Precision measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization
require extreme control of instrumental systematics. In a companion paper we
have presented cosmological constraints from observations with the BICEP2 and
Keck Array experiments up to and including the 2015 observing season (BK15),
resulting in the deepest CMB polarization maps to date and a statistical
sensitivity to the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $\sigma(r) = 0.020$. In this work
we characterize the beams and constrain potential systematic contamination from
main beam shape mismatch at the three BK15 frequencies (95, 150, and 220 GHz).
Far-field maps of 7,360 distinct beam patterns taken from 2010-2015 are used to
measure differential beam parameters and predict the contribution of
temperature-to-polarization leakage to the BK15 B-mode maps. In the
multifrequency, multicomponent likelihood analysis that uses BK15, Planck, and
WMAP maps to separate sky components, we find that adding this predicted
leakage to simulations induces a bias of $\Delta r = 0.0027 \pm 0.0019$. Future
results using higher-quality beam maps and improved techniques to detect such
leakage in CMB data will substantially reduce this uncertainty, enabling the
levels of systematics control needed for BICEP Array and other experiments that
plan to definitively probe large-field inflation.

          <p>Inflation is the currently accepted paradigm for the beginnings of the
Universe. To explain the observed almost scale invariant spectrum of density
perturbations with only a slight spectral tilt, inflation must have been "slow
roll", that is with a potential with sufficiently small slope. While the origin
of inflationary structure is intrinsically quantum mechanical, gravity gets
treated semiclassically within inflationary models. Recent work, in terms of
the so called de-Sitter swampland conjecture, has called into question whether
slow roll inflation is consistent with a complete theory of quantum gravity in
the presence of a positive vacuum energy density, which is a key ingredient in
the inflationary paradigm. In this work, we show that, in fact, if we
understand this conjecture correctly and with another swampland conjecture, the
so-called distance conjecture, involved we get a potential mechanism for slow
roll inflation and we argue that here fine-tuning is not a technical problem.

          <p>The Cold Spot, with an unusually cold region surrounded by a hot ring, is a
statistically significant anomaly in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) sky.
In this work we assess whether different sets of multiple subvoids based on the
2dF-VST ATLAS Cold Spot galaxy redshift survey or a collapsing cosmic texture
could have produced such an anomaly through a simultaneous search for their
gravitational redshift and lensing signatures on the {\it Planck} CMB
temperature anisotropies. We use patches with radii $R=10^\circ$ and
$R=20^\circ$ to account for the inner cold region as well as the outer hot
ring. As the void model, we explore two sets of $\Lambda$LTB templates
characterized by different values of the model's free parameters, and a top-hat
void template. We detect higher-than-expected gravitational redshift amplitudes
for the first two sets, $\mathcal{A}_{\rm rs}=5.4\pm 1.4$ and $\mathcal{A}_{\rm
rs}=14.4\pm 3.8$, and lower than expected for the top-hat model,
$\mathcal{A}_{\rm rs}=0.3 \pm 0.1$. The amplitudes for the lensing imprint are
consistent with zero for all these subvoid models. The estimated amplitude for
the texture imprint from the gravitational redshift measurement implies the
energy scale of the texture, parametrized by $\epsilon$, to be $\epsilon=
(7.6\pm2.0)\times 10^{-5}$, with no detection of the lensing trace. We note
that the deviation of the subvoid amplitudes from unity and the inability of
the texture and some of the void profiles to reproduce the hot ring indicate
theoretical insufficiencies, either in the construction of the model or in the
assumed gravitational and cosmological framework leading to the imprints for
the structures.

self-gravitating regular cosmic tube solutions which are superconducting, free
of curvature singularities and with non-trivial topological charge in the
Einstein-SU(2) non-linear sigma-model. These gravitating topological solitons
at a large distance from the axis look like a (boosted) cosmic string with an
angular defect given by the parameters of the theory, and near the axis, the
parameters of the solutions can be chosen so that the metric is singularity
free and without angular defect. The curvature is concentrated on a tube around
the axis. These solutions are similar to the Cohen-Kaplan global string but
regular everywhere, and the non-linear sigma-model regularizes the gravitating
global string in a similar way as a non-Abelian field regularizes the Dirac
monopole. Also, these solutions can be promoted to those of the fully coupled
Einstein-Maxwell non-linear sigma-model in which the non-linear sigma-model is
minimally coupled both to the U(1) gauge field and to General Relativity. The
analysis shows that these solutions behave as superconductors as they carry a
persistent current even when the U(1) field vanishes. Such persistent current
cannot be continuously deformed to zero as it is tied to the topological charge
of the solutions themselves. The peculiar features of the gravitational lensing
of these gravitating solitons are shortly discussed.

the dynamics of the phase transition, including the false vacuum fraction,

etc., for an expanding universe. We also study the full set of differential
equations governing the evolution of plasma and the scalar field during the
phase transition and generalize results obtained in Minkowski spacetime. In
particular, we generalize the sound shell model to the expanding universe and
determine the velocity field power spectrum. This ultimately provides an
accurate calculation of the gravitational wave spectrum seen today for the
dominant source of sound waves. For the amplitude of the gravitational wave
spectrum visible today, we find a suppression factor arising from the finite
lifetime of the sound waves and compare with the commonly used result in the
literature, which corresponds to the asymptotic value of our suppression
factor. We point out that the asymptotic value is only applicable for a very
long lifetime of the sound waves, which is highly unlikely due to the onset of
shocks, turbulence and other damping processes. We also point out that features
of the gravitational wave spectral form may hold the tantalizing possibility of
distinguishing between different expansion histories using phase transitions.

robustness of this "spectator dark matter" scenario to changes in the expansion
rate of the early Universe. Compared to the standard radiation-dominated (RD)
scenario, two aspects will change: the DM energy density evolves differently as
a function of time, and also the DM isocurvature perturbation spectrum will be
different from the result in the RD case. These can impose sizeable changes to
the values of model parameters which allow the field to constitute all DM while
simultaneously satisfying all observational constraints. We study both free and

Lagrangian perturbation schemes, in particular the Relativistic Zel'dovich
Approximation (RZA). We show that the second class of the Szekeres solutions is
exactly contained within the RZA when the latter is restricted to an
irrotational dust source with a flow-orthogonal foliation of spacetime. In such
a case, the solution is governed by the first principal scalar invariant of the
deformation field, proving a direct connection with a class of Newtonian
three-dimensional solutions without symmetry. For the second class, a necessary
and sufficient condition for the vanishing of cosmological backreaction on a
scale of homogeneity is expressed through integral constraints. Domains with no
backreaction can be smoothly matched, forming a lattice model, where exact
deviations average out at a given scale of homogeneity, and the homogeneous and
isotropic background is recovered as an average property of the model. Although
the connection with the first class of Szekeres solutions is not
straightforward, this class allows for the interpretation in terms of a spatial
superposition of nonintersecting fluid lines, where each world line evolves
independently and under the RZA model equations, but with different associated
`local backgrounds'. This points to the possibility of generalizing the
Lagrangian perturbation schemes to structure formation models on evolving

          <p>GW190521 challenges our understanding of the late-stage evolution of massive
stars and the effects of the pair-instability in particular. We discuss the
possibility that stars at low or zero metallicity could retain most of their
hydrogen envelope until the pre-supernova stage, avoid the pulsational
pair-instability regime and produce a black hole with a mass in the mass gap by
fallback. We present a series of new stellar evolution models at zero and low
metallicity computed with the Geneva and MESA stellar evolution codes and
compare to existing grids of models. Models with a metallicity in the range
0-0.0004 have three properties which favour higher BH masses as compared to
higher metallicity models. These are (i) lower mass-loss rates during the
post-MS phase, (ii) a more compact star disfavouring binary interaction and
(iii) possible H-He shell interactions which lower the CO core mass. We
conclude that it is possible that GW190521 may be the merger of black holes
produced directly by massive stars from the first stellar generations. Our
models indicate BH masses up to 70-75 Msun. Uncertainties related to convective
mixing, mass loss, H-He shell interactions and pair-instability pulsations may
increase this limit to ~85 Msun.

          <p>It is known that the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature
fluctuations are modified by gravitational lensing since the angular positions
of photons are altered by the metric perturbations. We reconsider this effect
in the context of geodesic deviation on a perturbed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
(FRW) spacetime with scalar and tensor modes. We first give an alternative
derivation of the Sachs-Wolfe effect by using the solutions of the null
geodesic equation. Then, we determine the two-dimensional induced metric on the
transverse cross section of the null geodesic congruence corresponding to a
beam of photons after decoupling. This metric, whose variation along the
congruence can be decomposed as expansion and shear, is shown to produce a
nontrivial intensity profile which can be characterized by three variables
analogous to the Stokes parameters of the polarization tensor.

          <p>Density perturbations related to structure formations are expected to be
different in dissipative and non-dissipative universes, even if the background
evolution of the two universes is the same. To clarify the difference between
the two universes, first-order density perturbations are studied, using two
types of holographic cosmological models. The first type is a "$\Lambda(t)$
model" similar to a time-varying $\Lambda(t)$ cosmology for the non-dissipative
universe. The second type is a "BV model" similar to a bulk viscous cosmology
for the dissipative universe. To systematically examine the two different
universes, a power-law term proportional to $H^{\alpha}$ is applied to the
$\Lambda(t)$ and BV (bulk-viscous-cosmology-like) models, assuming a flat
Friedmann--Robertson--Walker model for the late universe. Here, $H$ is the
Hubble parameter and $\alpha$ is a free parameter whose value is a real number.
The $\Lambda(t)$-$H^{\alpha}$ and BV-$H^{\alpha}$ models are used to examine
first-order density perturbations for matter, in which the background evolution
of the two models is equivalent. In addition, thermodynamic constraints on the
two models are discussed, with a focus on the maximization of entropy on the
horizon of the universe, extending previous analyses [Phys. Rev. D 100, 123545
(2019) (<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1911.08306">arXiv:1911.08306</a>); 102, 63512 (2020) (<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2006.09650">arXiv:2006.09650</a>)]. Consequently,
the $\Lambda(t)$-$H^{\alpha}$ model for small $|\alpha|$ values is found to be
consistent with observations and satisfies the thermodynamic constraints,
compared with the BV-$H^{\alpha}$ model. The results show that the
non-dissipative universe described by the $\Lambda(t)$-$H^{\alpha}$ model
similar to lambda cold dark matter models is likely favored.

          <p>Some million Type Ia supernovae (SN) will be discovered and monitored during
upcoming wide area time domain surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory
Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). For cosmological use, accurate
redshifts are needed among other characteristics; however the vast majority of
the SN will not have spectroscopic redshifts, even for their host galaxies,
only photometric redshifts. We assess the redshift systematic control necessary
for robust cosmology. Based on the photometric vs true redshift relation
generated by machine learning applied to a simulation of 500,000 galaxies as
observed with LSST quality, we quantify requirements on systematics in the mean
relation and in the outlier fraction and deviance so as not to bias dark energy
cosmological inference. Certain redshift ranges are particularly sensitive,
motivating spectroscopic followup of SN at $z\lesssim0.2$ and around
$z\approx0.5$-0.6. Including Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope near infrared
bands in the simulation, we reanalyze the constraints, finding improvements at
high redshift but little at the low redshifts where systematics lead to strong
cosmology bias. We identify a complete spectroscopic survey of SN host galaxies
for $z\lesssim0.2$ as a highly favored element for robust SN cosmology.

          <p>The discrepancy between early-Universe inferences and direct measurements of
the Hubble constant, known as the Hubble tension, recently became a pressing
subject in high precision cosmology. As a result, a large variety of
theoretical models have been proposed to relieve this tension. In this work we
analyze a conformally-coupled modified gravity (CCMG) model of an evolving
gravitational constant due to the coupling of a scalar field to the Ricci
scalar, which becomes active around matter-radiation equality, as required for
solutions to the Hubble tension based on increasing the sound horizon at
recombination. The model is theoretically advantageous as it has only one free
parameter in addition to the baseline $\Lambda$CDM ones. Inspired by similar
recent analyses of so-called early-dark-energy models, we constrain the CCMG
model using a combination of early and late-Universe cosmological datasets. In
addition to the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and
weak lensing measurements, baryon acoustic oscillations and the Supernova H0
for the Equation of State datasets, we also use large-scale structure (LSS)
datasets such as the Dark Energy Survey year 1 and the full-shape power
spectrum likelihood from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, including
its recent analysis using effective field theory, to check the effect of the
CCMG model on the (milder) S8 tension between the CMB and LSS. We find that the
CCMG model can slightly relax the Hubble tension, with $H_0 = 69.6 \pm 1.6$
km/s/Mpc at 95% CL, while barely affecting the S8 tension. However, current
data does not exhibit strong preference for CCMG over the standard cosmological
model. Lastly, we show that the planned CMB-S4 experiment will have the
sensitivity required to distinguish between the CCMG model and the more general
class of models involving an evolving gravitational constant.

          <p>In this study, we present an update of a compilation of line width
measurements of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) galaxy spectra at 21 cm
wavelength. Our All Digital HI (ADHI) catalog consists of the previous release
augmented with our new HI observations and an analysis of archival data. This
study provides the required HI information to measure the distances of spiral
galaxies through the application of the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation. We
conducted observations at the Green Bank telescope (GBT) and reprocessed
spectra obtained at the Nancay radiotelescope by the Nancay Interstellar
Baryons Legacy Extragalactic Survey (NIBLES) and Kinematics of the Local
Universe (KLUN) collaborations and we analyzed the recently published full
completion Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) 100% survey in order to identify
galaxies with good quality HI line width measurements. This paper adds new HI
data adequate for TF use for 385 galaxies observed at GBT, 889 galaxies from
archival Nancay spectra, and 1,515 rescaled Arecibo ALFALFA spectra. In total,
this release adds 1,274 new good quality measurements to the ADHI catalog.
Today, the ADHI database contains 18,874 galaxies, for which 15,433 have good
quality data for TF use. The final goal is to compute accurate distances to
spiral galaxies, which will be included in the next generation of peculiar
velocities catalog: Cosmicflows-4.
