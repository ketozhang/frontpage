forecast the intrinsic UV and X-ray luminosities of the AGN needed to give rise
to their double-peaked profiles. We also estimate the extent of the obscuration
of the AGN by comparing their luminosities to those of similar quasar samples
at these epochs. Future X-ray and radio observations, as well as those with the

contribution to the intergalactic-scale ionization zones of high-redshift LAEs.

          <p>We present an assessment of the CMB large scale anomalies in polarisation
using the two-point correlation function as a test case. We employ the state of
the art of large scale polarisation datasets: the first based on a Planck 2018
HFI 100 and 143 GHz cross-spectrum analysis, based on SRoll2 processing, and
the second from a map-based approach derived through a joint treatment of
Planck 2018 LFI and WMAP-9yr. We consider the well-known $S_{1/2}$ estimator,
which measures the distance of the two-point correlation function from zero at
angular scales larger than $60^{\circ}$, and rely on realistic simulations for
both datasets to assess confidence intervals. By focusing on the pure
polarisation field described by either the $Q$ and $U$ Stokes parameters or by
the local $E-$modes, we show that the first description is heavily influenced
by the quadrupole (which is poorly constrained in both datasets) while the
second one is more suited for an analysis containing higher multipoles up to
$\ell \sim 10$, limit above which both datasets become markedly noise
dominated. We find that both datasets exhibit a lack-of-correlation anomaly in
pure polarisation, similar to the one observed in temperature, which is better
constrained by the less noisy Planck HFI 100$\times$143 data, where its
significance lies at about $99.5\%$. We perform our analysis using realizations
that are either constrained or non-constrained by the observed temperature
field, and find similar results in the two cases.

          <p>The splashback radius, $R_{\rm sp}$, is a physically motivated halo boundary
that separates infalling and collapsed matter of haloes. We study $R_{\rm sp}$
in the hydrodynamic and dark matter only IllustrisTNG simulations. The most
commonly adopted signature of $R_{\rm sp}$ is the radius at which the radial
density profiles are steepest. Therefore, we explicitly optimise our density
profile fit to the profile slope and find that this leads to a $\sim5\%$ larger
radius compared to other optimisations. We calculate $R_{\rm sp}$ for haloes
with masses between $10^{13-15}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ as a function of halo mass,
accretion rate and redshift. $R_{\rm sp}$ decreases with mass and with redshift
for haloes of similar $M_{\rm200m}$ in agreement with previous work. We also
find that $R_{\rm sp}/R_{\rm200m}$ decreases with halo accretion rate. We apply
our analysis to dark matter, gas and satellite galaxies associated with haloes
to investigate the observational potential of $R_{\rm sp}$. The radius of
steepest slope in gas profiles is consistently smaller than the value
calculated from dark matter profiles. The steepest slope in galaxy profiles,
which are often used in observations, tends to agree with dark matter profiles
but is lower for less massive haloes. We compare $R_{\rm sp}$ in hydrodynamic
and N-body dark matter only simulations and do not find a significant
difference caused by the addition of baryonic physics. Thus, results from dark
matter only simulations should be applicable to realistic haloes.

          <p>The redshifted 21-cm signal of neutral Hydrogen is a promising probe into the
period of evolution of our Universe when the first stars were formed (Cosmic
Dawn), to the period where the entire Universe changed its state from being
completely neutral to completely ionized (Reionization). The most striking
feature of this line of neutral Hydrogen is that it can be observed across an
entire frequency range as a sky-averaged continuous signature, or its
fluctuations can be measured using an interferometer. However, the 21-cm signal
is very faint and is dominated by a much brighter Galactic and extra-galactic
foregrounds, making it an observational challenge. We have used different
physical models to simulate various realizations of the 21-cm Global signals,
including an excess radio background to match the amplitude of the EDGES 21-cm
signal. First, we have used an artificial neural network (ANN) to extract the
astrophysical parameters from these simulated datasets. Then, mock observations
were generated by adding a physically motivated foreground model and an ANN was
used to extract the astrophysical parameters from such data. The $R^2$ score of
our predictions from the mock-observations is in the range of 0.65-0.89. We
have used this ANN to predict the signal parameters giving the EDGES data as
the input. We find that the reconstructed signal closely mimics the amplitude
of the reported detection. The recovered parameters can be used to infer the
physical state of the gas at high redshifts.

The BNN can accurately characterize the posterior PDFs of model parameters
governing the elliptical power-law mass profile in an external shear field. We
then propagate the BNN-inferred posterior PDFs into ensemble $H_0$ inference,
using simulated time delay measurements from a plausible dedicated monitoring
campaign. Assuming well-measured time delays and a reasonable set of priors on
the environment of the lens, we achieve a median precision of $9.3$\% per lens
in the inferred $H_0$. A simple combination of 200 test-set lenses results in a
precision of 0.5 $\textrm{km s}^{-1} \textrm{ Mpc}^{-1}$ ($0.7\%$), with no
detectable bias in this $H_0$ recovery test. The computation time for the
entire pipeline -- including the training set generation, BNN training, and
$H_0$ inference -- translates to 9 minutes per lens on average for 200 lenses
and converges to 6 minutes per lens as the sample size is increased. Being
fully automated and efficient, our pipeline is a promising tool for exploring
ensemble-level systematics in lens modeling for $H_0$ inference.

          <p>We present deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry of the ultra-faint
dwarf galaxy Eridanus II (Eri II). Eri II, which has an absolute magnitude of
M_V = -7.1, is located at a distance of 339 kpc, just beyond the virial radius
of the Milky Way. We determine the star formation history of Eri II and measure
the structure of the galaxy and its star cluster. We find that a star formation
history consisting of two bursts, constrained to match the spectroscopic
metallicity distribution of the galaxy, accurately describes the Eri II stellar
population. The best-fit model implies a rapid truncation of star formation at
early times, with &gt;80% of the stellar mass in place before z~6. A small
fraction of the stars could be as young as 8 Gyr, but this population is not
statistically significant; Monte Carlo simulations recover a component younger
than 9 Gyr only 15% of the time, where they represent an average of 7 +/- 4% of
the population. These results are consistent with theoretical expectations for
quenching by reionization. The HST depth and angular resolution enable us to
show that Eri II's cluster is offset from the center of the galaxy by a
projected distance of 23 +/- 3 pc. This offset could be an indication of a
small (~50-75 pc) dark matter core in Eri II. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
cluster has a high ellipticity of 0.31 +0.05/-0.06 and is aligned with the
orientation of Eri II within 3 +/- 6 degrees, likely due to tides. The stellar
population of the cluster is indistinguishable from that of Eri II itself.

          <p>Over the last years some interest has been gathered by $f(Q)$ theories, which
are new candidates to replace Einstein's prescription for gravity. The
non-metricity tensor $Q$ allows to put forward the assumption of a free
torsionless connection and, consequently, new degrees of freedom in the action
are taken into account. This work focuses on a class of $f(Q)$ theories,
characterized by the presence of a general power-law term which adds up to the
standard (linear in) $Q$ term in the action, and on new cosmological scenarios
arising from them. Using the Markov chain Montecarlo method we carry out
statistical tests relying upon background data such as Type Ia Supernovae
luminosities and direct Hubble data (from cosmic clocks), along with Cosmic
Microwave Background shift and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations data. This allows
us to perform a multifaceted comparison between these new cosmologies and the
(concordance) $\Lambda$CDM setup. We conclude that, at the current precision
level, the best fits of our $f(Q)$ models correspond to values of their
specific parameters which make them hardly distinguishable from our General

selected using the RASS survey and then identified as galaxy clusters using the

precisely accounting for the sample selection effects on the clustering and
demonstrate their robustness using numerical simulations. Methods. Using the
clean CODEX sample, which was obtained by applying a redshift-dependent
richness selection, we computed the two-point autocorrelation function of
galaxy clusters in the $0.1&lt;z&lt;0.3$ and $0.3&lt;z&lt;0.5$ redshift bins. We compared
the bias in the measured correlation function with values obtained in numerical

law, we measured a correlation length $r_0=18.7 \pm 1.1$ and slope $\gamma=1.98
\pm 0.14$ for the correlation function in the full redshift range. By fixing
the other cosmological parameters to their WMAP9 values, we reproduced the
observed shape of the correlation function under the following cosmological
conditions: $\Omega_{m_0}=0.22^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ and $S_8=\sigma_8 (\Omega_{m_0}
/0.3)^{0.5}=0.85^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$ with estimated additional systematic errors
of $\sigma_{\Omega_{m_0}} = 0.02$ and $\sigma_{S_8} = 0.20$. We illustrate the
complementarity of clustering constraints by combining them with CODEX
cosmological constraints based on the X-ray luminosity function, deriving
$\Omega_{m_0} = 0.25 \pm 0.01$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.81^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$ with an
estimated additional systematic error of $\sigma_{\Omega_{m_0}} = 0.07$ and

          <p>Upcoming 21cm surveys will map the spatial distribution of cosmic neutral
hydrogen (HI) over unprecedented volumes. Mock catalogues are needed to fully
exploit the potential of these surveys. Standard techniques employed to create
these mock catalogs, like Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD), rely on
assumptions such as the baryonic properties of dark matter halos only depend on
their masses. In this work, we use the state-of-the-art magneto-hydrodynamic
simulation IllustrisTNG to show that the HI content of halos exhibits a strong
dependence on their local environment. We then use machine learning techniques
to show that this effect can be 1) modeled by these algorithms and 2)
parametrized in the form of novel analytic equations. We provide physical
explanations for this environmental effect and show that ignoring it leads to
underprediction of the real-space 21-cm power spectrum at $k\gtrsim 0.05$ h/Mpc
by $\gtrsim$10\%, which is larger than the expected precision from upcoming
surveys on such large scales. Our methodology of combining numerical
simulations with machine learning techniques is general, and opens a new
direction at modeling and parametrizing the complex physics of assembly bias

          <p>Among all cosmological quantum-gravity or quantum-gravity-inspired scenarios,
only very few predict a blue-tilted primordial tensor spectrum. We explore five
of them and check whether they can generate a stochastic gravitational-wave
background detectable by present and future interferometers: non-local quantum
gravity, string-gas cosmology, new ekpyrotic scenario, Brandenberger-Ho
non-commutative inflation and multi-fractional spacetimes. We show that
non-local quantum gravity is unobservable, while all the other models can reach
the strain sensitivity of DECIGO but not that of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, LISA or

          <p>Maps of cosmic structure produced by galaxy surveys are one of the key tools
for answering fundamental questions about the Universe. Accurate theoretical
predictions for these quantities are needed to maximize the scientific return
of these programs. Simulating the Universe by including gravity and
hydrodynamics is one of the most powerful techniques to accomplish this;
unfortunately, these simulations are very expensive computationally.
Alternatively, gravity-only simulations are cheaper, but do not predict the
locations and properties of galaxies in the cosmic web. In this work, we use
convolutional neural networks to paint galaxy stellar masses on top of the dark
matter field generated by gravity-only simulations. Stellar mass of galaxies
are important for galaxy selection in surveys and thus an important quantity
that needs to be predicted. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art
benchmark model and allows the generation of fast and accurate models of the
observed galaxy distribution.

fields is compared with the numerical $N$-body simulations. Recently, weakly
non-Gaussian formula of Minkowski functionals is extended to include the
second-order effects of non-Gaussianity in general dimensions. We apply this
formula to the three-dimensional density field in the large-scale structure of
the Universe. The parameters of the second-order formula include several kinds
of skewness and kurtosis parameters. We apply the tree-level nonlinear
perturbation theory to estimate these parameters. First we compare the
theoretical values with those of numerical simulations on the basis of
parameter values, and next we test the performance of the analytic formula
combined with the perturbation theory. The second-order formula outperforms the
first-order formula in general. The performance of the perturbation theory
depends on the smoothing radius applied in defining the Minkowski functionals.

          <p>Cosmologists aim to model the evolution of initially low amplitude Gaussian
density fluctuations into the highly non-linear "cosmic web" of galaxies and
clusters. They aim to compare simulations of this structure formation process
with observations of large-scale structure traced by galaxies and infer the
properties of the dark energy and dark matter that make up 95% of the universe.
These ensembles of simulations of billions of galaxies are computationally
demanding, so that more efficient approaches to tracing the non-linear growth
of structure are needed. We build a V-Net based model that transforms fast
linear predictions into fully nonlinear predictions from numerical simulations.
Our NN model learns to emulate the simulations down to small scales and is both
faster and more accurate than the current state-of-the-art approximate methods.
It also achieves comparable accuracy when tested on universes of significantly
different cosmological parameters from the one used in training. This suggests
that our model generalizes well beyond our training set.

signatures in the spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations if the
inflationary energy scale is sufficiently high. In this paper we further
investigate the effects of a coupling of the Inflaton field to higher-curvature

an observable violation of the tensor consistency relation from
higher-curvature tensors implies also a relatively large running of the tensor

slow roll case. This may leave signatures in the tensor two-point function that
we could test to recognize higher-curvature effects, above all if they are
translated into a blue tilted spectrum visible by future Gravitational Wave
experiments. Exploiting current cosmic microwave background and gravitational

that large higher-curvature corrections seem to be disfavored.

          <p>We provide a theoretical model of $F(R)$ gravity in which it is possible to
describe in a unified way inflation, an early and a late dark energy era, in
the presence of a light axion particle which plays the role of the dark matter
component of the Universe. Particularly, the early-time phenomenology is
dominated by an $R^2$ term, while the presence of the other terms $f(R)$ ensure
the occurrence of the early and late-time dark energy eras. The inflationary
phenomenology is compatible with the Planck 2018 data for inflation, while the
late-time dark energy era is compatible with the Planck 2018 constraints on the
cosmological parameters. Also, the model exhibits an early dark energy era, at
$z\sim 2.5$ approximately, followed by a deceleration era, which starts at
approximately $z\sim 1.5$, which in turn is followed by a late-time dark energy
era for redshifts $z\sim 0.5$, which lasts for approximately 5 billion years up
to present time. A notable feature of our model is that the dark energy era is
free from dark energy oscillations, at least in the redshift interval
$z=[0,10]$. In addition, we also discuss several features related to
observational data at $z\sim 2.34$, at which redshift intricate observational
data exist in the literature. Moreover, the numerical code for the dark energy
phenomenology, written in Python 3, is presented in the end of the article.
Finally, the model has another interesting characteristic, a sudden jump of the
value of the Hubble rate in the redshift interval $z\sim [2,2.6]$ where its
value suddenly increases and then decreases until $z\sim 0$.

          <p>We present genetIC, a new code for generating initial conditions for
cosmological N-body simulations. The code allows precise, user-specified
alterations to be made to arbitrary regions of the simulation (while
maintaining consistency with the statistical ensemble). These "genetic
modifications" allow, for example, the history, mass, or environment of a
target halo to be altered in order to study the effect on their evolution. The
code natively supports initial conditions with nested zoom regions at
progressively increasing resolution. Modifications in the high-resolution
region must propagate self-consistently onto the lower resolution grids; to
enable this while maintaining a small memory footprint, we introduce a
Fourier-space filtering approach to generating fields at variable resolution.
Due to a close correspondence with modifications, constrained initial
conditions can also be produced by genetIC (for example with the aim of
matching structures in the local Universe). We test the accuracy of
modifications performed within zoom initial conditions. The code achieves
sub-percent precision, which is easily sufficient for current applications in
galaxy formation.

          <p>A totally asymptotically free QCD axion model, where all couplings flow to
zero in the infinite energy limit, was recently formulated. A very interesting
feature of this fundamental theory is the ability to predict some low-energy
observables, like the masses of the extra fermions and scalars. Here we find
and investigate a region of the parameter space where the Peccei-Quinn (PQ)
symmetry is broken quantum mechanically through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism.
This results in an even more predictive framework: the axion sector features
only two independent parameters (the PQ symmetry breaking scale and the QCD
gauge coupling). In particular, we show that the PQ phase transition is
strongly first order and can produce gravitational waves within the reach of
future detectors. The predictivity of the model leads to a rigid dependence of
the phase transition (like its duration and the nucleation temperature) and the
gravitational wave spectrum on the PQ symmetry breaking scale and the QCD gauge
coupling.

          <p>The patch like model of the hierarchical galaxy formation in the $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological model with small damping scale is considered. In this model
galaxies and clusters of galaxies are identified with rare high density peaks,
what suppresses the action of random factors in the vicinity of peaks and makes
the process of halos formation more rapid and regular. High concentration of
irregular subhalos surrounding the central peaks and their subsequent merging
just after formation allows to consider this medium as a mixture of
collisionless dispersed dark matter (DM) particles and collisional subhalos.
Merging of these subhalos with the central dominating halo is accompanied by
tidal destruction of the central cusp, what progressively shallows the density
profile and promotes formation of super massive central black holes. In the
framework of this model we can reproduce the observed correlation of mass and
density of virialized galaxies and clusters of galaxies known as the virial
paradox [4,5]. These correlations are closely linked with the composition of DM
and the shape of the power spectrum what allows to restrict them using already
available observations. These correlations put constraints on the HDM and WDM
models and allow to test models of cosmological inflation. We confirm that the
missing satellite problem is directly linked with the virial paradox and
reheating of the Universe which increases temperature and entropy of the
baryons, prevents formation of first stars and divides halos into two
populations: the first one includes galaxies formed before reheating which are
mainly concentrated in the vicinity of the massive ones while the second
population -- numerous dark halos formed after reheating -- accumulates
majority of DM but does not contain stars. Their spatial distribution is more
homogeneous.

          <p>Beyond-$\Lambda$CDM physics or systematic errors may cause subsets of a
cosmological data set to appear inconsistent when analyzed assuming
$\Lambda$CDM. We present an application of internal consistency tests to
measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 (DES Y1) joint probes analysis.
Our analysis relies on computing the posterior predictive distribution (PPD)
for these data under the assumption of $\Lambda$CDM. We find that the DES Y1
data have an acceptable goodness of fit to $\Lambda$CDM, with a probability of
finding a worse fit by random chance of ${p = 0.046}$. Using numerical PPD
tests, supplemented by graphical checks, we show that most of the data vector
appears completely consistent with expectations, although we observe a small
tension between large- and small-scale measurements. A small part (roughly
1.5%) of the data vector shows an unusually large departure from expectations;
excluding this part of the data has negligible impact on cosmological
constraints, but does significantly improve the $p$-value to 0.10. The
methodology developed here will be applied to test the consistency of DES Year
3 joint probes data sets.

          <p>Massive ETGs are thought to form through a two-phase process. At early times,
an intense and fast starburst forms blue and disk-dominated galaxies. After
quenching, the remaining structures become red, compact and massive, i.e., 'red
nuggets'. Then, a time-extended second phase which is dominated by mergers,
causes structural evolution and size growth. Given the stochastic nature of
mergers, a small fraction of red nuggets survives, without any interaction,
massive and compact until today: relic galaxies. Since this fraction depends on
the processes dominating the size growth, counting relics at low-z is a
valuable way to disentangle between different galaxy evolution models. In this
paper, we introduce the INvestigating Stellar Population In RElics (INSPIRE)
Project, that aims at spectroscopically confirming and fully characterizing a
large number of relics at 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.5. We focus here on the first results based
on a pilot program targeting three systems, representative of the whole sample.
For these, we extract 1D optical spectra over an aperture comprising ~30 % of
the galaxies light, and obtain line-of-sight integrated stellar velocity and
velocity dispersion. We also infer the stellar [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance from
line-index measurements and mass-weighted age and metallicity from
full-spectral fitting with single stellar population models. Two galaxies have
large integrated stellar velocity dispersion values, confirming their massive
nature. They are populated by stars with super-solar metallicity and
[$\alpha$/Fe]. Both objects have formed &gt;80 % of their stellar mass within a
short (0.5 - 1.0 Gyrs) initial star formation episode occurred only ~1 Gyr
after the Big Bang. The third galaxy has a more extended star formation history
and a lower velocity dispersion. Thus we confirm two out of three candidates as
relics.

          <p>We measure the size-mass relation and its evolution between redshifts
1$&lt;z&lt;$3, using galaxies lensed by six foreground Hubble Frontier Fields
clusters. The power afforded by strong gravitation lensing allows us to observe
galaxies with higher angular resolution beyond current facilities. We select a
stellar mass limited sample and divide them into star-forming or quiescent
classes based on their rest-frame UVJ colors from the ASTRODEEP catalogs.
Source reconstruction is carried out with the recently-released $lenstruction$
software, which is built on the multi-purpose gravitational lensing software
$lenstronomy$. We derive the empirical relation between size and mass for the
late-type galaxies with $M_{*}&gt;3\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$ at 1$&lt;z&lt;$2.5 and $M_* &gt;5
\times 10^{9} M_{\odot}$ at 2.5$&lt;z&lt;$3, and at a fixed stellar mass, we find
galaxy sizes evolve as $R_{eff}\propto (1+z)^{-1.05\pm0.37}$. The intrinsic
scatter is $&lt;0.1$ dex at $z&lt;1.5$ but increases to $\sim0.3$ dex at higher
redshift. The results are in good agreement with those obtained in blank
fields. We evaluate the uncertainties associated with the choice of lens model
by comparing size measurements using five different and publicly available
models, finding the choice of lens model leads to a 3.7 % uncertainty of the
median value, and $\sim 25$ % scatter for individual galaxies. Our work
demonstrates the use of strong lensing magnification to boost resolution does
not introduce significant uncertainties in this kind of work, and paves the way
for wholesale applications of the sophisticated lens reconstruction technique
to higher redshifts and larger samples.

          <p>We reconsider the problem of the birefringence of electromagnetic waves in a
medium consisting of a plasma and $\nu\bar{\nu}$ gas within the Standard Model
of particle physics. The considered effect arises in such a medium due to the
parity violation for the electroweak neutrino-electron interaction. The recent
calculations of the electroweak correction to the photon polarization operator
in the electroweak plasma allow us to significantly improve some previous
estimates of such effect in astrophysics. We estimate the rotary power for an
electromagnetic wave propagating in a non-relativistic plasma in the
intergalactic space and interacting with the gas of relic neutrinos and
antineutrinos there. The possibility to observe this effect experimentally is
discussed.

          <p>We put forward novel extensions of Starobinsky inflation, involving a class
of 'geometric' higher-curvature corrections that yield second-order
Friedmann-Lema\^itre equations and second-order-in-time linearized equations
around cosmological backgrounds. We determine the range of models within this
class that admit an extended phase of slow roll inflation as an attractor. By
embedding these theories in anti-de Sitter space, we derive holographic
'unitarity' bounds on the two dominant higher-order curvature corrections.
Finally we compute the leading corrections to the spectral properties of scalar
and tensor primordial perturbations, including the modified consistency
relation $r=-8n_{T}$. Remarkably, the range of models singled out by holography
nearly coincides with the current observational bounds on the scalar spectral
tilt. Our results indicate that future observations have the potential to
discriminate between different higher-curvature corrections considered here.
