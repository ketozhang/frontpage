          <p>We utilise the latest cosmological data and EFCLASS, our modified version of
the Boltzmann solver CLASS following the Effective Fluid Approach, to derive
constraints on three modified gravity models using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
method. In particular, we analyse the Designer $f(R)$ (DES-fR) and Designer
Horndeski (HDES) models, but also the Hu $\&amp;$ Sawicki $f(R)$ model (HS). We
find tight constraints on the modified gravity parameters that parametrize the
deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model. For both the DES-fR and the HS model we
obtain $\log_{10}b&lt;-8$ at $68\%$ confidence when all data, i.e., Planck 18, CMB
lensing, BAO, the Pantheon compilation, the $H_0$ Riess measurement and the RSD
Gold-18 compilation, are included. In the case of the HDES model we find a
somewhat weaker value of $\log_{10}&gt;-5$ at $68\%$ confidence. We also examine
the degeneracy between modified gravity and the neutrino mass and we find that
the presence of the neutrino mass as a free parameter loosens the constraints.
Compared to other standard analyses our Effective Fluid Approach has a couple
of advantages. First, we model the background expansion for the various models
correctly, something which is not always done in other codes and second, we
examine the degeneracy with the sum of the neutrinos masses.

          <p>A new set of field equations for a space-time dependent Newton's constant
$G(x)$ and cosmological constant $\Lambda(x)$ in the presence of matter is
presented. We prove that it represents the most general mathematically
consistent, physically plausible, set of evolution equations assuming at most
second derivatives in the dynamical variables. In the new Einstein's equations,
only $\Lambda$-kinetic terms arise, while in the modified conservation
equation, derivative terms of $G$ also appear. As an application, this

early universe, assuming a perfect fluid with a radiation equation of state.
Cosmological solutions are obtained for all types of spatial curvature,
displaying a variety of interesting cosmic evolutions. As an indication of such
behaviours, bouncing solutions, recollapsing solutions or non-singular

          <p>Understanding the physics of large cosmological surveys down to small
(nonlinear) scales will significantly improve our knowledge of the Universe.
Large N-body simulations have been built to obtain predictions in the
non-linear regime. However, N-body simulations are computationally expensive
and generate large amount of data, putting burdens on storage. These data are
snapshots of the simulated Universe at different times, and fine sampling is
necessary to accurately save its whole history. We employ a deep neural network
model to predict the nonlinear N-body simulation at an intermediate time step
given two widely separated snapshots. Our results outperform the cubic Hermite
interpolation benchmark method in interpolating N-body simulations. This work
can greatly reduce the storage requirement and allow us to reconstruct the
cosmic history from far fewer snapshots of the universe.

          <p>Massive black holes in the central region of galaxies radiate a vast amount
of light as active galactic nuclei by releasing gravitational energy of
accreting gas when a sufficient amount of gas accretes onto the massive black
holes. Galaxy collisions have been thought to enhance nucleus activity, by
triggering mass fueling to the central massive black hole through angular
momentum transfer. Here we show that galaxy collisions are also capable of
suppressing black hole fueling by using an analytic model and three-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations, applying the well-determined parameter sets for the
galactic collision in the Andromeda galaxy. Our models demonstrate that a
central collision of galaxies can strip the torus-shaped gas surrounding the
massive black hole, the putative fueling source, away via momentum transfer
between the torus gas and the infalling gas when the column-density of the
infalling gas is higher than that of the torus. The derived condition for
switching-off the black hole fueling indicates that a significant fraction of
currently bright nuclei can become inactive, reminiscent of fading/dying active
nucleus phenomena associated with galaxy merging events. Galaxy collisions may
therefore be responsible both for switching-off and turning-on the nucleus
activity, depending on the collision orbit (head-on or far-off-centre).

          <p>We investigate scenarios with $\mathcal{O}(1\mathrm{\,TeV})$ scalar
leptoquarks that act as portals between the Standard Model and Dark Matter. We
assume that Dark Matter is a scalar singlet $S$ which couples to a scalar
leptoquark $\Delta$ and the Higgs boson via the terms in the scalar potential.
In addition, the leptoquark is endowed with Yukawa couplings to quarks and
leptons that may address the anomalies in $B$ meson decays. We consider the
$SS$ annihilation cross sections to estimate the Dark Matter relic abundance
and explore the interplay between astrophysical, collider and flavour physics
bounds on such models. In the heavy Dark Matter window, $m_S &gt; m_\Delta$, the
leptoquark portal becomes the dominant mechanism to explain the Dark Matter
abundance. We find that the leptoquark Yukawa couplings, relevant for quark and
lepton flavour physics, are decoupled from the dark matter phenomenology. By
focussing on a scenario with a single leptoquark state, we find that relic
density can only be explained when both $\Delta$ and $S$ masses are lighter
than $\mathcal{O}(10\mathrm{\,TeV})$.

Kinetic Field Theory framework for cosmic large-scale structure formation with
the established formalism of Eulerian Standard Perturbation Theory. We
highlight the qualitative differences of both approaches by a comparative
analysis of the respective equations of motion and implementation of initial
conditions. A natural starting point for a first quantitative comparison is
given by the non-interacting regime of free-streaming kinematics. Our results
suggest that Kinetic Field Theory contains a complete resummation of Standard
Perturbation Theory in this regime. We further show that the exact
free-streaming solution of Kinetic Field Theory can not be recovered in any

          <p>The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) offers a new opportunity
to observe signals of primordial features from inflationary models. We study
their detectability with future space-based gravitational waves experiments,
focusing our analysis on the frequency range of the LISA mission. We compute
gravitational wave spectra from primordial features by exploring the parameter
space of a two-field inflation model capable of generating different classes of
features. Fine-tuning in scales and amplitudes is necessary for these signals
to fall in the observational windows. Once they show up, several classes of
frequency-dependent oscillatory signals, characteristic of different underlying
inflationary physics, may be distinguished and the SGWB provides a window on
dynamics of the primordial universe independent of cosmic microwave background
and large-scale structure. To connect with future experimental data, we discuss
two approaches of how the results may be applied to data analyses. First, we
discuss the possibility of reconstructing the signal with LISA, which requires
a high signal-to-noise ratio. The second more sensitive approach is to apply
templates representing the spectra as estimators. For the latter purpose, we
derive templates that can accurately capture the spectral features of several
classes of feature signals and compare them with the SGWB produced by other
physical mechanisms.

Voigt profile analysis to combine spectra taken with different instruments, to
reduce systematics and to remove metal-line contamination. We confirm
previously known conclusions on firmer quantitative grounds in particular by
improving the measurements at z~1. Two flux statistics at 0&lt;F&lt;1, the mean HI
flux and the flux probability distribution function (PDF), show that
considerable evolution occurs from z=3.6 to z=1.5, after which it slows down to
become effectively stable for z&lt;0.5. However, there are large sightline
variations. For the HI column density distribution function (CDDF, f proptional

decreases from beta~1.60 at z~3.4 to beta~1.82 at z~0.1. The CDDF shape at
lower redshifts can be reproduced by a small amount of clockwise rotation of a
higher-z CDDF with a slightly larger CDDF normalisation. The absorption line
number per z (dn/dz) shows a similar evolutionary break at z~1.5 as seen in the
flux statistics. High-N(HI) absorbers evolve more rapidly than low-N(HI)
absorbers to decrease in number or cross-section with time. The individual
dn/dz shows a large scatter at a given z. The scatter increases toward lower z,

          <p>Recent cosmological analyses (e.g., JLA, Pantheon) of Type Ia Supernova
(SNIa) have propagated systematic uncertainties into a covariance matrix and
either binned or smoothed the systematic vectors in redshift space. We
demonstrate that systematic error budgets of these analyses can be improved by
a factor of $\sim1.5\times$ with the use of unbinned and unsmoothed covariance
matrices. To understand this, we employ a separate approach that simultaneously
fits for cosmological parameters and additional self-calibrating scale
parameters that constrain the size of each systematic. We show that the
covariance-matrix approach and scale-parameter approach yield equivalent
results, implying that in both cases the data can self-calibrate certain
systematic uncertainties, but that this ability is hindered when information is
binned or smoothed in redshift space. We review the top systematic
uncertainties in current analyses and find that the reduction of systematic
uncertainties in the unbinned case depends on whether a systematic is
consistent with varying the cosmological model and whether or not the
systematic can be described by additional correlations between SN properties
and luminosity. Furthermore, we show that the power of self-calibration
increases with the size of the dataset, which presents a tremendous opportunity
for upcoming analyses of photometrically classified samples, like those of
Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope
(NGRST). However, to take advantage of self-calibration in large,
photometrically-classified samples, we must first address the issue that
binning is required in currently-used photometric methodologies.

oscillations with observable imprints on cosmology. Oscillations are resonantly
enhanced if the dark photon mass equals the ordinary photon plasma mass, which
tracks the free electron number density. Previous studies have assumed a
homogeneous Universe; in this Letter, we introduce for the first time an
analytic formalism for treating resonant oscillations in the presence of
inhomogeneities of the photon plasma mass. We apply our formalism to determine
constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background photons oscillating into dark

inhomogeneities demonstrates that prior homogeneous constraints are not

          <p>We propose a new mechanism where asymmetric dark matter (ADM) and the baryon
asymmetry are both generated in the same decay chain of a metastable weakly
interacting massive particle (WIMP) after its thermal freeze-out. Dark matter
and baryons are connected by a generalized baryon number that is conserved,
while the DM asymmetry and baryon asymmetry compensate each other. This unified
framework addresses the DM-baryon coincidence while inheriting the merit of the
conventional WIMP miracle in predicting relic abundances of matter. Examples of
renormalizable models realizing this scenario are presented. These models
generically predict ADM with sub-GeV to GeV-scale mass that interacts with
Standard Model quarks or leptons, thus rendering potential signatures at direct
detection experiments sensitive to low mass DM. Other interesting
phenomenological predictions are also discussed, including: LHC signatures of
new intermediate particles with color or electroweak charge and DM induced
nucleon decay; the long-lived WIMP may be within reach of future high energy
collider experiments.

          <p>An accurate theoretical template for the galaxy power spectrum is a key for
the success of ongoing and future spectroscopic surveys. We examine to what
extent the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure is able to provide
such a template and correctly estimate cosmological parameters. To that end, we
initiate a blinded challenge to infer cosmological parameters from the
redshift-space power spectrum of high-resolution mock catalogs mimicking the
BOSS galaxy sample but covering a hundred times larger cumulative volume. This
gigantic simulation volume allows us to separate systematic bias due to
theoretical modeling from the statistical error due to sample variance. The
challenge task was to measure three unknown input parameters used in the
simulation: the Hubble constant, the matter density fraction, and the
clustering amplitude. We present analyses done by two independent teams, who
have fitted the mock simulation data generated by yet another independent
group. This allows us to avoid any confirmation bias by analyzers and pin down
possible tuning of the specific EFT implementations. Both independent teams
have recovered the true values of the input parameters within sub-percent
statistical errors corresponding to the total simulation volume.

          <p>We point out that in models of macroscopic topological defects composed of
one or more scalar fields that interact with standard-model fields via
scalar-type couplings, the back-action of ambient matter on the scalar field(s)
produces an environmental dependence of the fundamental constants of nature, as
well as spatial variations of the fundamental constants in the vicinity of
dense bodies such as Earth due to the formation of a "bubble-like" defect
structure surrounding the dense body. In sufficiently dense environments,
spontaneous symmetry breaking may be inhibited altogether for $\phi^2$
interactions, potentially delaying the cosmological production of topological
defects. We derive bounds on non-transient variations of the fundamental
constants from torsion-pendulum experiments that search for
equivalence-principle-violating forces, experiments comparing the frequencies
of ground- and space-based atomic clocks, as well as ground-based clocks at
different heights in the recent Tokyo Skytree experiment, and measurements
comparing atomic and molecular transition frequencies in terrestrial and
low-density astrophysical environments. Our results constrain the present-day
mass-energy fraction of the Universe due to a network of infinite domain walls
produced shortly after the BBN or CMB epochs to be $\Omega_{\textrm{walls},0}
\ll 10^{-10}$ for the symmetron model with a $\phi^4$ potential and $\phi^2$
interactions, improving over CMB quadrupolar temperature anisotropy bounds by
at least 5 orders of magnitude. Our newly derived bounds on domain walls with
$\phi^2$ interactions via their effects of non-transient variations of the
fundamental constants are significantly more stringent than previously reported
clock- and cavity-based limits on passing domain walls via transient signatures
and previous bounds from different types of non-transient signatures, under the
same set of assumptions.

TNG100-3 and TNG300-3), considering their full and dark-only versions, in
redshifts ranging from $z = 0$ to $z=5$, and different cell sizes. We evaluated
two CiC models: the gravitational quasi-equilibrium distribution (GQED) and the
negative binomial distribution (NBD), both presenting good fits, with small
detectable differences in the presence of baryons. Scaling and time
dependencies of the best-fit parameters showed similar trends compared with the
literature. We derived a matter density-in-cells probability distribution
function (PDF), associated with the GQED, which was compared to the PDF given
in Uhlemann et al. (2016), for the IllustrisTNG 100-3-Dark run at $z=0$. Our
results indicate that the simplest gravithermodynamical assumptions of the GQED
model hold in the presence of baryonic dissipation. Interestingly, the smoothed
(density-in-cells) version of the GQED is also adequate for describing the dark
matter one-point statistics of subhaloes and converges, to subpercentage levels
(for an interval of parameters), to the Uhlemann et al. PDF in the high density
range.

          <p>In an earlier paper, a new class of thin-shell cavities were proposed to
evade the steep frequency scaling of conventional axion haloscopes. In this
follow-up work, we see that a generalized conic geometry enables robust
frequency-tuning for these large-volume cm-wave cavities. The
frequency-defining dimension of a conic shell-cavity changes symmetrically and
uniformly during tuning, maintaining a high axion coupling efficiency (the form
factor) to an external solenoid field. It is further shown that such tunable
geometry is not restricted to circular cones. A general prescription for
arbitrary volume-filling conic shell-cavities is developed and direct solutions
are obtained for the created numerical models. The largest of the realized
designs is a meandering "brain" cavity that is tunable over a frequency range
of 20%. The scan rate of this cavity is three orders of magnitude larger than
that of a scaled cylindrical cavity used in the current generation experiments.
The prospects for such a large improvement in the scan rate should motivate R &amp;
D efforts in fabrication and other implementation techniques. If these
engineering challenges can be met, cavity-based axion haloscopes can stay
competitive at frequencies higher than a few GHz. We propose an experimental
configuration at 20 GHz (~ 80 $\mu$eV) using an array of brain cavities and
compare it with other proposals for similar frequencies.

          <p>The $AKARI$ space infrared telescope has performed near- to mid-infrared
(MIR) observations on the North Ecliptic Pole Wide (NEPW) field (5.4 deg$^2$)
for about one year. $AKARI$ took advantage of its continuous nine photometric
bands, compared with NASA's $Spitzer$ and WISE space telescopes, which had only
four filters with a wide gap in the MIR. The $AKARI$ NEPW field lacked deep and
homogeneous optical data, limiting the use of nearly half of the IR sources for
extra-galactic studies owing to the absence of photometric redshifts
(photo-zs). To remedy this, we have recently obtained deep optical imaging over
the NEPW field with 5 bands ($g$, $r$, $i$, $z$, and $Y$) of the Hyper
Suprime-Camera (HSC) on the Subaru 8m telescope. We optically identify AKARI-IR
sources along with supplementary $Spitzer$ and WISE data as well as
pre-existing optical data. In this work, we derive new photo-zs using a
$\chi^2$ template-fitting method code ($Le$ $Phare$) and reliable photometry
from 26 selected filters including HSC, $AKARI$, CFHT, Maidanak, KPNO,
$Spitzer$ and WISE data. We take 2026 spectroscopic redshifts (spec-z) from all
available spectroscopic surveys over the NEPW to calibrate and assess the
accuracy of the photo-zs. At z &lt; 1.5, we achieve a weighted photo-z dispersion
of $\sigma_{\Delta{z/(1+z)}}$ = 0.053 with $\eta$ = 11.3% catastrophic errors.

          <p>The apparent missing mass in galaxies and galaxy clusters, commonly viewed as
evidence for dark matter, could possibly originate from gradients in the
gravitational coupling parameter, $G$, and active gravitational mass,
$M_{act}$, rather than hypothetical beyond-the-standard-model particles. We
argue that in (the weak field limit of) a Weyl-invariant extension of General
Relativity, one can simply affect the change $\Phi_{b}(x)\rightarrow\Phi_{b}(x)
+ \Phi_{DM}(x)$, where $\Phi_{b}$ is the baryon-sourced potential and
$\Phi_{DM}$ is the `excess' potential. This is compensated by gradients of
$GM_{act}$ and a fractional increase of $O(-4\Phi_{DM}(x))$ in the baryon
density, well below current detection thresholds on all relevant scales.
