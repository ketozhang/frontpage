          <p>Low-scale baryogenesis could be discovered at $B$-factories and the LHC. In
the $B$-Mesogenesis paradigm, the CP violating oscillations and subsequent
decays of $B$ mesons in the early Universe simultaneously explain the origin of
the baryonic and the dark matter of the Universe. This mechanism for baryo- and
dark matter-genesis from $B$ mesons gives rise to distinctive signals at
collider experiments, which we scrutinize in this paper. We study CP violating
observables in the $B^0_q-\bar{B}_q^0$ system, discuss current and expected
sensitivities for the exotic decays of $B$ mesons into a visible baryon and
missing energy, and explore the implications of direct searches for a TeV-scale
colored scalar at the LHC and in meson-mixing observables. Remarkably, we
conclude that a combination of measurements at BaBar, Belle, Belle II, LHCb,
ATLAS and CMS can fully test $B$-Mesogenesis.

          <p>Standard methodologies for the extraction of the stochastic gravitational
wave background (SGWB) from auto- or cross-correlation of interferometric
signals often involve the use of a filter function. The standard optimal filter
maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between the total SGWB and the noise.
We derive expressions for the optimal filter and SNR in the presence of a
target SGWB plus other unwanted components. We also generalize the methodology
to the case of template-free reconstruction. The formalism allows to easily
perform analyses and forecasts that marginalize over foreground signals, such
as the typical $\Omega_{\rm GW} \propto f^{2/3}$ background arising from binary
coalescence. We demonstrate the methodology with the LISA mission and discuss
possible extensions and domains of application.

          <p>We present a new suite of mock galaxy catalogs mimicking the low-redshift
Universe, based on an updated halo occupation distribution (HOD) model and a
scaling relation between optical properties and the neutral hydrogen (HI)
content of galaxies. Our algorithm is constrained by observations of the
luminosity function and luminosity- and colour-dependent clustering of SDSS
galaxies, as well as the HI mass function and HI-dependent clustering of
massive HI-selected galaxies in the ALFALFA survey. Mock central and satellite
galaxies with realistic values of $r$-band luminosity, $g-r$ and $u-r$ colour,
stellar mass and HI mass are populated in an $N$-body simulation, inheriting a
number of properties of the density and tidal environment of their host halos.
The host halo of each central galaxy is also `baryonified' with realistic
spatial distributions of stars as well as hot and cold gas, along with the
corresponding rotation curve. Our default HOD assumes that galaxy properties
are a function of group halo mass alone, and can optionally include effects
such as galactic conformity and colour-dependent galaxy assembly bias. The
mocks predict the relation between the stellar mass and HI mass of massive HI
galaxies, as well as the 2-point cross-correlation function of spatially
co-located optical and HI-selected samples. These mocks form the basis of a
number of applications we will pursue in other work, such as novel null tests
for galaxy assembly bias, predictions for the HI velocity width function and
testing the universality of the radial acceleration relation.

          <p>Abundance matching (AM) is a popular technique for assigning galaxy mass or
luminosity to haloes produced in $N$-body simulations. The method works by
matching the cumulative number functions of the galaxy and halo properties, and
is therefore sensitive both to the precise definitions of those properties and
to the selection criteria used to define the samples. Further dependence
follows when AM parameters are calibrated with galaxy clustering, which is
known to depend strongly on the manner in which galaxies are selected. In this
paper we introduce a new parametrisation for AM and derive the best-fit AM
parameters as a function of various properties of the selection of the galaxy
sample and of the photometric definition, including S\'ersic vs Petrosian
magnitudes, stellar masses vs $r$-band magnitudes and optical (SDSS) vs HI
(ALFALFA) selection. In each case we calculate the models' goodness-of-fit to
measurements of the projected two-point galaxy correlation function. In the
optically-selected samples we find strong evidence that the scatter in the
galaxy-halo connection increases towards the faint end, and that AM performs
better with luminosity than stellar mass. The AM parameters of optically- and
HI-selected galaxies are mutually exclusive, with the latter suggesting the
importance of properties beyond halo mass. We provide best-fit parameters for
the AM galaxy-halo connection as a function of each of our input choices,
extending the domain of validity of the model while reducing potential
systematic error in its use.

          <p>This article aims at drawing the attention of astronomers on the ability of
future cosmological surveys to put constraints on string theory. The fact that
quantum gravity might be constrained by large scale astrophysical observations
is a remarkable fact that has recently concentrated a great amount of interest.
In this work, we focus on future observatories and investigate their capability
to put string theory, which is sometimes said to be unfalsifiable, under
serious pressure. We show that the combined analysis of SKA, Euclid, and the
Vera Rubin observatory - together with Planck results - could improve
substantially the current limits on the relevant string swampland parameter. In
particular, our analysis leads to a nearly model-independent prospective upper
bound on the quintessence potential, |V'|/V&lt;0.16, in strong contradiction with
the so-called de Sitter conjecture. Some lines of improvements for the very
long run are also drawn, together with generic prospective results, underlining
the efficiency of this approach. The conjectures used in this work are
discussed pedagogically, together with the cosmological models chosen in the
analysis.

4-dimensional membrane embedded in the 5-dimensional bulk spacetime and fit the

phenomenology of this scenario, we consider the models with the brane
cosmological constant and the negative bulk cosmological constant. The
contribution from the bulk is represented as the holographic dark fluid on the
membrane. We derive the universal modified Friedmann equation by including all
of these effects in both braneworld and holographic cutoff approaches. For
three specific models, namely, the pure hFRW model, the one with the brane

constant, we compare the model predictions with the observations. The
parameters in the considered hFRW models are constrained with observational

          <p>Up-to-date cosmological data analyses have shown that \textit{(a)} a closed
universe is preferred by the Planck data at more than $99\%$ CL, and
\textit{(b)} interacting scenarios offer a very compelling solution to the
Hubble constant tension. In light of these two recent appealing scenarios, we
consider here an interacting dark matter-dark energy model with a non-zero
spatial curvature component and a freely varying dark energy equation of state
in both the quintessential and phantom regimes. When considering Cosmic
Microwave Background data only, a phantom and closed universe can perfectly
alleviate the Hubble tension, without the necessity of a coupling among the
dark sectors. Accounting for other possible cosmological observations
compromises the viability of this very attractive scenario as a global solution
to current cosmological tensions, either by spoiling its effectiveness
concerning the $H_0$ problem, as in the case of Supernovae Ia data, or by
introducing a strong disagreement in the preferred value of the spatial
curvature, as in the case of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations.

          <p>We present the first quantum field theory model of inflation that is
renormalizable in the matter sector, with a super-Hubble inflaton mass and
sub-Planckian field excursions, which is thus technically natural and
consistent with a high-energy completion within a theory of quantum gravity.
This is done in the framework of warm inflation, where we show, for the first
time, that strong dissipation can fully sustain a slow-roll trajectory with
slow-roll parameters larger than unity in a way that is both theoretically and
observationally consistent. The inflaton field corresponds to the relative
phase between two complex scalar fields that collectively break a U(1) gauge
symmetry, and dissipates its energy into scalar degrees of freedom in the warm
cosmic heat bath. A discrete interchange symmetry protects the inflaton mass
from large thermal corrections. We further show that the dissipation
coefficient decreases with temperature in certain parametric regimes, which
prevents a large growth of thermal inflaton fluctuations. We find, in
particular, a very good agreement with the Planck legacy data for a simple
quadratic inflaton potential, predicting a low tensor-to-scalar ratio
$r\lesssim 10^{-5}$.

          <p>One of the problem revealed recently in cosmology is a so-called Hubble
tension (HT), which is the difference between values of the present Hubble
constant, measured by observation of the universe at redshift $z \lesssim 1$,
and by observations of a distant universe with CMB fluctuations originated at
$z \sim 1100$. In this paper we suggest, that this discrepancy may be explained
by deviation of the cosmological expansion from a standard Lambda-CDM %simple
Friedman model of a flat universe, during the period after recombination at $z
\lesssim 1100$, due to action of additional variable component of a dark energy
of different origin.. We suppose, that a dark matter (DM) has a common origin
with a variable component of a dark energy (DEV). DE presently may have two
components, one of which is the Einstein constant $\Lambda$, and another,
smaller component DEV ($\Lambda_V$) comes from the remnants of a scalar fields
responsible for inflation. Due to common origin and interconnections the
densities of DEV and DM are supposed to be connected, and remain almost
constant during, at least, the time after recombination, when we may
approximate $\rho_{DM}=\alpha \rho_{DEV}$. This part of the dark energy in not
connected with the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, but is defined by existence
of scalar fields with a variable density. Taking into account the influence of
DEV on the universe expansion we find the value of $\alpha$ which could remove
the HT problem. In order to maintain the almost constant DEV/DM energy density
ratio during the time interval at $z&lt;1100$, we suggest an existence of a wide
mass DM particle distribution.

          <p>Systematic understanding for classes of inflationary models is investigated
from the viewpoint of the local conformal symmetry and the slightly broken
global symmetry in the framework of the metric-affine geometry. In the
metric-affine geometry, which is a generalisation of the Riemannian one adopted
in the ordinary General Relativity, the affine connection is an independent
variable of the metric rather than given e.g. by the Levi-Civita connection as
its function. Thanks to this independency, the metric-affine geometry can
preserve the local conformal symmetry in each term of the Lagrangian contrary
to the Riemannian geometry, and then the local conformal invariance can be
compatible with much more kinds of global symmetries. As simple examples, we
consider the two-scalar models with the broken $\mathrm{SO}(1,1)$ or
$\mathrm{O}(2)$, leading to the well-known $\alpha$-attractor or natural
inflation, respectively. The inflaton can be understood as their pseudo
Nambu-Goldstone boson.

with a mass nearing the limit set by small scale structure (${\cal O} ( 10 ^{ -

showing that requiring the axion to have a matter-power spectrum that matches
that of cold dark matter constrains the magnitude of the axion couplings to the
visible sector. Comparing these limits to current and future experimental
efforts, we find that many searches require axions with an abnormally large
coupling to Standard Model fields, independently of how the axion was populated
in the early universe. We survey mechanisms that can alleviate the bounds,
namely, the introduction of large charges, various forms of kinetic mixing, a
clockwork structure, and imposing a discrete symmetry. We provide an explicit
model for each case and explore their phenomenology and viability to produce
detectable ultralight axion dark matter.

lead to a two-field attractor-type double inflation, whose first stage is
driven by Starobinsky scalaron and the second stage is driven by another scalar
belonging to a supergravity multiplet. The PBHs formation in our supergravity
models is efficient, compatible with all observational constraints, and
predicts a stochastic GW background. We compute the PBH-induced GW power

          <p>We present an updated version of the HMcode augmented halo model that can be
used to make accurate predictions of the non-linear matter power spectrum over
a wide range of cosmologies. Major improvements include modelling of BAO
damping in the power spectrum and an updated treatment of massive neutrinos. We
fit our model to simulated power spectra and show that we can match the results
with an RMS error of 2.5 per cent across a range of cosmologies, scales $k &lt;
10\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and redshifts $z&lt;2$. The error rarely exceeds 5 per
cent and never exceeds 16 per cent. The worst-case errors occur at $z\simeq2$,
or for cosmologies with unusual dark-energy equations of state. This represents
a significant improvement over previous versions of HMcode, and over other
popular fitting functions, particularly for massive-neutrino cosmologies with
high neutrino mass. We also present a simple halo model that can be used to
model the impact of baryonic feedback on the power spectrum. This six-parameter
physical model includes gas expulsion by AGN feedback and encapsulates star
formation. By comparing this model to data from hydrodynamical simulations we
demonstrate that the power spectrum response to feedback is matched at the $&lt;1$
per cent level for $z&lt;1$ and $k&lt;20\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also present a
single-parameter variant of this model, parametrized in terms of feedback
strength, which is only slightly less accurate. We make code available for our
non-linear and baryon models at https://github.com/alexander-mead/HMcode and it

          <p>Planned efforts to probe the largest observable distance scales in future
cosmological surveys are motivated by a desire to detect relic correlations
left over from inflation, and the possibility of constraining novel
gravitational phenomena beyond General Relativity (GR). On such large scales,
the usual Newtonian approaches to modelling summary statistics like the power
spectrum and bispectrum are insufficient, and we must consider a fully
relativistic and gauge-independent treatment of observables such as galaxy
number counts in order to avoid subtle biases, e.g. in the determination of the
$f_{\rm NL}$ parameter. In this work, we present an initial application of an
analysis pipeline capable of accurately modelling and recovering relativistic
spectra and correlation functions. As a proof of concept, we focus on the
non-zero dipole of the redshift-space power spectrum that arises in the
cross-correlation of different mass bins of dark matter halos, using strictly
gauge-independent observable quantities evaluated on the past light cone of a
fully relativistic N-body simulation in a redshift bin $1.7 \le z \le 2.9$. We
pay particular attention to the correct estimation of power spectrum
multipoles, comparing different methods of accounting for complications such as
the survey geometry (window function) and evolution/bias effects on the past
light cone, and discuss how our results compare with previous attempts at
extracting novel GR signatures from relativistic simulations.

          <p>Metacalibration is a state-of-the-art technique for measuring weak
gravitational lensing shear from well-sampled galaxy images. We investigate the
accuracy of shear measured with metacalibration from fitting elliptical
Gaussians to undersampled galaxy images. In this case, metacalibration
introduces aliasing effects leading to an ensemble multiplicative shear bias
about 0.01 for Euclid, and even larger for the Roman Space Telescope, well
exceeding the missions' requirements. We find that this aliasing bias can be
mitigated by computing shapes from weighted moments with wider Gaussians as
weight functions, thereby trading bias for a slight increase in variance of the
measurements. We show that this approach is robust to the point-spread function
in consideration and meets the stringent requirements of Euclid for galaxies
with moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios. We therefore advocate
metacalibration as a viable shear measurement option for weak lensing from
upcoming space missions.

          <p>Brief periods of non-slow-roll evolution during inflation can produce
interesting observable consequences, as primordial black holes, or an
inflationary gravitational wave spectrum enhanced at small scales. We develop a
model independent, analytic approach for studying the predictions of
single-field scenarios which include short phases of slow-roll violation. Our
method is based on Taylor expanding the equations for cosmological fluctuations
in a small quantity, which parameterizes the duration of the non-slow-roll
eras. The super-horizon spectrum of perturbations is described by few effective
parameters, and is characterized by a pronounced dip followed by a rapid growth
in its amplitude, as typically found in numerical and analytical studies. The
dip position $k_{\rm dip}/k_*$ and the maximal enhancement $\Pi_{\rm max}$ of
the spectrum towards small scales are found to be related by the law $k_{\rm
dip}/k_*\propto \Pi_{\rm max}^{-1/4}$, and we determine the proportionality
constant. For a single epoch of slow-roll violation we confirm previous
studies, finding that the steepest slope of the spectrum well after the dip has
spectral index $n-1\,=\,4$. On the other hand, with multiple phases of
slow-roll violation, the slope of the spectrum is generally enhanced. For
example, when two epochs of slow-roll violation take place, separated by a
phase of quasi-de Sitter expansion, we find that the spectral index can reach
the value $n-1\,=\,8$. This phenomenon indicates that the slope of the spectrum
keeps memory of the history of non-slow-roll phases occurred during inflation.

parameters on cosmological constraints from cluster catalogs similar to those
from Planck, those expected from the Euclid, Roman and Rubin surveys, and from
a hypothetical larger future survey. We analyse simulated catalogs in each
case, gradually loosening priors on HMF parameters to evaluate the degradation
in cosmological constraints. While current uncertainties on HMF parameters do
not substantially impact Planck-like surveys, we find that they can
significantly degrade the cosmological constraints for a Euclid-like survey.
Consequently, the current precision on the HMF will not be sufficient for
Euclid (or Roman or Rubin) and possible larger surveys. Future experiments will
have to properly account for uncertainties in HMF parameters, and it will be
necessary to improve precision of HMF fits to avoid weakening constraints on
cosmological parameters.
