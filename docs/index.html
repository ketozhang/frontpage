          <p>We use six, high-resolution $\Lambda$CDM simulations of galaxy formation to
study how emission from dark matter annihilation is affected by baryonic
processes. These simulations produce isolated, disc-dominated galaxies with
structure, stellar populations, and stellar and halo masses comparable to those
of the Milky Way. They resolve dark matter structures with mass above $\sim
10^6$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ and are each available in both full-physics and
dark-matter-only versions. In the full-physics case, formation of the stellar
galaxy enhances annihilation radiation from the dominant smooth component of
the galactic halo by a factor of three, and its central concentration increases
substantially. In contrast, subhalo fluxes are $reduced$ by almost an order of
magnitude, partly because of changes in internal structure, partly because of
increased tidal effects; they drop relative to the flux from the smooth halo by
1.5 orders of magnitude. The expected flux from the brightest subhalo is four
orders of magnitude below that from the smooth halo, making it very unlikely
that any subhalo will be detected before robust detection of the inner Galaxy.
We use recent simulations of halo structure across the full $\Lambda$CDM mass
range to extrapolate to the smallest (Earth-mass) subhaloes, concluding, in
contrast to earlier work, that the total annihilation flux from Milky Way
subhaloes will be less than that from the smooth halo, as viewed both from the
Sun and by a distant observer. Fermi-LAT may marginally resolve annihilation
radiation from the very brightest subhaloes, which, typically, will contain
stars.

          <p>We present morphological classifications of $\sim$27 million galaxies from
the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Data Release 1 (DR1) using a supervised deep
learning algorithm. The classification scheme separates: (a) early-type
galaxies (ETGs) from late-types (LTGs); and (b) face-on galaxies from edge-on.
Our Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are trained on a small subset of DES
objects with previously known classifications. These typically have
$\mathrm{m}_r \lesssim 17.7~\mathrm{mag}$; we model fainter objects to
$\mathrm{m}_r &lt; 21.5$ mag by simulating what the brighter objects with well
determined classifications would look like if they were at higher redshifts.
The CNNs reach 97% accuracy to $\mathrm{m}_r&lt;21.5$ on their training sets,
suggesting that they are able to recover features more accurately than the
human eye. We then used the trained CNNs to classify the vast majority of the
other DES images. The final catalog comprises five independent CNN predictions
for each classification scheme, helping to determine if the CNN predictions are
robust or not. We obtain secure classifications for $\sim$ 87% and 73% of the
catalog for the ETG vs. LTG and edge-on vs. face-on models, respectively.
Combining the two classifications (a) and (b) helps to identify edge-on
lenticular galaxies. Where a comparison is possible, our classifications
correlate very well with S\'ersic index ($n$), ellipticity ($\epsilon$) and
spectral type, even for the fainter galaxies. This is the largest multi-band
catalog of automated galaxy morphologies to date.

        <strong>Orbital pericenters and the inferred dark matter halo structure of satellite galaxies. (arXiv:2012.07865v1 [astro-ph.GA])</strong>

          <p>Using the phat-ELVIS suite of Milky Way-size halo simulations, we show that
subhalo orbital pericenters, $r_{\rm peri}$, correlate with their dark matter
halo structural properties. Specifically, at fixed maximum circular velocity,
$V_{\rm max}$, subhalos with smaller $r_{\rm peri}$ are more concentrated (have
smaller $r_{\rm max}$ values) and have lost more mass, with larger peak
circular velocities, $V_{\rm peak}$, prior to infall. These trends provide
information that can tighten constraints on the inferred $V_{\rm max}$ and
$V_{\rm peak}$ values for known Milky Way satellites. We illustrate this using
published pericenter estimates enabled by Gaia for the nine classical Milky Way
dwarf spheroidal satellites. The two densest dSph satellites (Draco and Ursa
Minor) have relatively small pericenters, and this pushes their inferred
$r_{\rm max}$ and $V_{\rm max}$ values lower than they would have been without
pericenter information. For Draco, we infer $V_{\rm max} = 23.5 \, \pm 3.3$ km
s$^{-1}$ (compared to $27.3 \, \pm 7.1$ km s$^{-1}$ without pericenter
information). Such a shift exacerbates the traditional Too Big to Fail problem.
Draco's peak circular velocity range prior to infall narrows from $V_{\rm peak}
= 21 - 49$ km s$^{-1}$ without pericenter information to $V_{\rm peak} = 25-37$
km s$^{-1}$ with the constraint. Over the full population of classical dwarf
spheroidals, we find no correlation between $V_{\rm peak}$ and stellar mass
today, indicative of a high level of stochasticity in galaxy formation at
stellar masses below $\sim 10^7$ M$_\odot$. As proper motion measurements for
dwarf satellites become more precise, they should enable useful priors on the
expected structure and evolution of their host dark matter subhalos.

          <p>We make forecasts for the impact a future "midband" space-based gravitational
wave experiment, most sensitive to $10^{-2}- 10 $ Hz, could have on potential
detections of cosmological stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs).
Specific proposed midband experiments considered are TianGo, B-DECIGO and
AEDGE. We propose a combined power-law integrated sensitivity (CPLS) curve
combining GW experiments over different frequency bands, which shows the
midband improves sensitivity to SGWBs by up to two orders of magnitude at
$10^{-2} - 10$ Hz. We consider GW emission from cosmic strings and phase
transitions as benchmark examples of cosmological SGWBs. We explicitly model
various astrophysical SGWB sources, most importantly from unresolved black hole
mergers. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we demonstrated that midband
experiments can, when combined with LIGO A+ and LISA, significantly improve
sensitivities to cosmological SGWBs and better separate them from astrophysical
SGWBs. In particular, we forecast that a midband experiment improves
sensitivity to cosmic string tension $G\mu$ by up to a factor of $10$, driven
by improved component separation from astrophysical sources. For phase
transitions, a midband experiment can detect signals peaking at $0.1 - 1$ Hz,
which for our fiducial model corresponds to early Universe temperatures of
$T_*\sim 10^4 - 10^6$ GeV, generally beyond the reach of LIGO and LISA. The
midband closes an energy gap and better captures characteristic spectral shape
information. It thus substantially improves measurement of the properties of
phase transitions at lower energies of $T_* \sim O(10^3)$ GeV, potentially
relevant to new physics at the electroweak scale, whereas in this energy range
LISA alone will detect an excess but not effectively measure the phase
transition parameters. Our modelling code and chains are publicly available.

absorption spectra, both sightlines show several isolated resolved (full width

Ly$\beta$. The incidence of such spikes decreases with increasing redshift, but
both sightlines show significant spikes at z&gt;3.5, signaling the presence of
fully ionized regions in the z&gt;3.5 intergalactic medium (IGM). We employ an
automated algorithm to compare the number of detected HeII transmission spikes
to predictions from mock spectra created from the outputs of a cubic (100/h

background photoionization rates $\Gamma_\mathrm{HeII}$. From the incidence of

          <p>A promising candidate for cold dark matter is primordial black holes (PBH)
formed from strong primordial quantum fluctuations. A necessary condition for
the formation of PBH's is a change of sign in the tilt governing the anomalous
scale invariance of the power spectrum from red at large scales into blue at
small scales. Non-perturbative information on the dependence of the power
spectrum tilt on energy scale can be extracted from the quantum Fisher
information measuring the energy dependence of the quantum phases defining the
de Sitter vacua. We show that this non-perturbative quantum tilt goes from a
red tilted phase, at large scales, into a blue tilted phase at small scales
converging to $n_s=2$ in the UV. This allows the formation of PBH's in the

          <p>Hydrogen Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission has been one of the major
observational probes for the high redshift universe, since the first
discoveries of high-$z$ Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies in the late 1990s. Due to
the strong Ly$\alpha$ emission originated by resonant scattering and
recombination of the most-abundant element, Ly$\alpha$ observations witness not
only HII regions of star formation and AGN but also diffuse HI gas in the
circum-galactic medium (CGM) and the inter-galactic medium (IGM). Here we
review Ly$\alpha$ sources, and present theoretical interpretations reached to
date. We conclude that: 1) A typical Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) at $z\gtrsim 2$
with a $L^*$ Ly$\alpha$ luminosity is a high-$z$ counterpart of a local dwarf
galaxy, a compact metal-poor star-forming galaxy (SFG) with an approximate
stellar (halo) mass and star-formation rate of $10^{8-9} M_\odot$ ($10^{10-11}
M_\odot$) and $1-10 M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively; 2) High-$z$ SFGs
ubiquitously have a diffuse Ly$\alpha$ emitting halo in the CGM extending to
the halo virial radius and beyond; 3) Remaining neutral hydrogen at the epoch
of reionization makes a strong dimming of Ly$\alpha$ emission for galaxies at
$z&gt;6$ that suggest the late reionization history. The next generation large
telescope projects will combine Ly$\alpha$ emission data with HI Ly$\alpha$
absorptions and 21cm radio data that map out the majority of hydrogen (HI+HII)
gas, uncovering the exchanges of i) matter by outflow/inflow and ii) radiation,
relevant to cosmic reionization, between galaxies and the CGM/IGM.

          <p>In previous works we have derived a Running Vacuum Model (RVM) for a string
Universe, which provides an effective description of the evolution of
4-dimensional string-inspired cosmologies from inflation till the present
epoch. In the context of this "stringy RVM" version, it is assumed that the
early Universe is characterised by purely gravitational degrees of freedom,
from the massless gravitational string multiplet, including the antisymmetric
tensor field. The latter plays an important role, since its dual gives rise to
a `stiff' gravitational-axion "matter", which in turn couples to the
gravitational anomaly terms, assumed to be non-trivial at early epochs. In the
presence of primordial gravitational wave (GW) perturbations, such anomalous
couplings lead to an RVM-like dynamical inflation, without external inflatons.
We review here this framework and discuss potential scenarios for the
generation of such primordial GW, among which the formation of unstable domain
walls, which eventually collapse in a non-spherical-symmetric manner, giving
rise to GW. We also remark that the same type of "stiff" axionic matter could
provide, upon the generation of appropriate potentials during the
post-inflationary eras, (part of) the Dark Matter (DM) in the Universe, which
could well be ultralight, depending on the parameters of the string-inspired
model. All in all, the new (stringy) mechanism for RVM-inflation preserves the
basic structure of the original (and more phenomenological) RVM, as well as its
main advantages: namely, a mechanism for graceful exit and for generating a
huge amount of entropy capable of explaining the horizon problem. It also
predicts axionic DM and the existence of mild dynamical Dark Energy (DE) of
quintessence type in the present universe, both being "living fossils" of the
inflationary stages of the cosmic evolution.

          <p>In the inflation-based cosmology the dark matter (DM) density component
starts moving with respect to the universal expansion at $z_{\rm eq}\sim 3,200$
while baryons remain frozen until $z_{\rm rec}\sim 1,100$. It has been
suggested that in this case post-linear corrections to the evolution of small
fluctuations would result, for the standard $\Lambda$-dominated cold DM (CDM)
model, in delayed formation of early objects as supersonic advection flows
develop after recombination, so baryons are not immediately captured by the DM
gravity on small scales. We develop the hydrodynamical description of such
two-component advection and show that, in the supersonic regime, the advection
within irrotational fluids is governed by the gradient of the difference of the
kinetic energies of the two (DM and baryonic here) components. We then apply
this formalism to the case where DM is made up of LIGO-type black holes (BHs)
and show that there the advection process on scales relevant for early
structure collapse will differ significantly from the earlier discussed (CDM)
case because of the additional granulation component to the density field
produced during inflation. The advection here will lead efficiently to the
common motion of the DM and baryon components on scales relevant for collapse
and formation of first luminous sources.This leads to early collapse making
easier to explain the existence of supermassive BHs observed in quasars at high
$z&gt;7$. The resultant net advection rate reaches minimum around $&lt; 10^9M_\odot$
and subsequently rises to a secondary maximum near the typical mass of $\sim
10^{12}M_\odot$, which may be an important consideration for formation of

          <p>It has long been argued that the radial distribution of globular clusters
(GCs) in the Fornax dwarf galaxy requires its dark matter halo to have a core
of size $\sim 1$ kpc. We revisit this argument by investigating analogues of
Fornax formed in E-MOSAICS, a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation that
self-consistently follows the formation and evolution of GCs in the EAGLE
galaxy formation model. In EAGLE, Fornax-mass haloes are cuspy and well
described by the Navarro-Frenk-White profile. We post-process the E-MOSAICS to
account for GC orbital decay by dynamical friction, which is not included in
the original model. Dynamical friction causes 33 per cent of GCs with masses
$M_{\rm GC}\geq4\times10^4 {~\rm M_\odot}$ to sink to the centre of their host
where they are tidally disrupted. Fornax has a total of five GCs, an
exceptionally large number compared to other galaxies of similar stellar mass.
In the simulations, we find that only 3 per cent of the Fornax analogues have
five or more GCs, while 30 per cent have only one and 35 per cent have none. We
find that GC systems in satellites are more centrally concentrated than in
field dwarfs, and that those formed in situ (45 per cent) are more concentrated
than those that were accreted. The survival probability of a GC increases
rapidly with the radial distance at which it formed ($r_{\rm init}$): it is 37
per cent for GCs with $r_{\rm init} \leq 1$ kpc and 92 per cent for GCs with
$r_{\rm init} \geq 1$ kpc. The present-day radial distribution of GCs in
E-MOSAICS turns out to be indistinguishable from that in Fornax, demonstrating
that, contrary to claims in the literature, the presence of five GCs in the
central kiloparsec of Fornax does not exclude a cuspy DM halo.

          <p>We calculate the gravitational waves (GWs) induced by the density
fluctuations due to inhomogeneous distribution of primordial black holes (PBHs)
in the case where PBHs eventually dominate and reheat the universe by Hawking
evaporation. The initial PBH density fluctuations are isocurvature in nature.
We find that most of the induced GWs are generated right after evaporation,
when the universe transits from the PBH dominated era to the radiation
dominated era and the curvature perturbation starts to oscillate wildly. The
strongest constraint on the amount of the produced GWs comes from the big bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN). We improve previous constraints on the PBH fraction and
find that it cannot exceed $10^{-4}$. Furthermore, this maximum fraction
decreases as the mass increases and reaches $10^{-12}$ for $M_{\rm PBH}\sim
5\times10^8 {\rm g}$, which is the largest mass allowed by the BBN constraint
on the reheating temperature. Considering that PBH may cluster above a given
clustering scale, we also derive a lower bound on the scale of clustering.
Interestingly, the GW spectrum for $M_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^4 -10^8 {\rm g}$ enters
the observational window of LIGO and DECIGO and could be tested in the future.
Although we focus on the PBH dominated early universe in this paper, our
methodology is applicable to any model with early isocurvature perturbation.

introduce some among the most prominent cosmological models embedded in
theories of quantum gravity, while in the second case we point out certain

can be affected by perturbative as well as non-perturbative quantum-gravity

luminosity distance of GW sources. While many quantum-gravity models do not
give rise to any observable signal, some predict a blue-tilted stochastic

interferometers. We conclude that it is difficult, but still possible, to test

          <p>Gravitational waves (GWs) may be magnified or de-magnified due to lensing.
This phenomena will bias our distance estimation based on the matched filtering
technic. In this paper, we study the GW magnification effect with particular
attention to the stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs). Our lensing models
cover the most popular galaxy lens model in the market, namely singular
isothermal sphere (SIS), singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) and power-law
elliptical mass distribution (PEMD) models. Applying our models to aLIGO/Virgo
O1+O2 run data, we find that for $d_{\mathrm{obs}} \lesssim 2860~\mathrm{Mpc}$,
which is the aLIGO/Virgo observational horizon limit, the averaged
magnification keeps as unity with the standard deviation
$\sigma_{\mu}\simeq0.1\sim0.2$, depending on the lens modeling. The
corresponding distance estimation errors are about $5\%\sim10\%$. For the case
of beyond observational horizon ($d_{\mathrm{obs}} \gtrsim 2860~\mathrm{Mpc}$),
we have $\langle\mu\rangle=20\sim30$, $\sigma_{\mu}=15\sim25$ and
$\sigma_{d}/d_{{\rm obs}}=30\%\sim40\%$. Furthermore, we forecast these numbers
for Einstein Telescope (ET) configuration. We find that the averaged
magnification keeps unity with a tiny scatter ($\sigma_{\mu}\lesssim0.1$) until
redshift $z=6.5$ (or $d_{\mathrm{obs}}=65~\mathrm{Gpc}$). The distance
estimation error due to lensing under ET configuration is about
$\sigma_{d}/d_{{\rm obs}}=4\%\sim5\%$.

          <p>The counting of pairs of galaxies or stars according to their distance is at
the core of all real-space correlation analyzes performed in astrophysics and
cosmology. The next stage upcoming ground (LSST) and space (Euclid) surveys
will measure properties of billions of galaxies and tomographic shells will
contain hundreds of millions of objects. The combinatorics of the pair count
challenges our ability to perform such counting in a minute-scale time which is
the order of magnitude useful for optimizing analyses through the intensive use
of simulations. The problem is not CPU intensive and is only limited by an
efficient access to the data, hence it belongs to the "big data" category. We
use the popular Apache Spark framework to address it and design an efficient
high-throughput algorithm to deal with hundreds of millions to billions of
input data. To optimize it, we revisit the question of nonhierarchical sphere
pixelization based on cube symmetries and develop a new one that we call the
"Similar Radius Sphere Pixelization" (SARSPix) with square-like pixels. It
provides the most adapted sphere packing for all distance-related computations.
Using LSST-like fast simulations, we compute autocorrelation functions on
tomographic bins containing between a hundred million to one billion data
points. In all cases we achieve the full construction of a classical
pair-distance histogram in about 2 minutes, using a moderate number of worker
nodes (16 to 64). This is typically two orders of magnitude higher than what is
achieved today and shows the potential of using these new techniques in the
field of astronomy on ever-growing datasets. The method presented here is
flexible enough to be adapted to any medium size cluster and the software is
publicly available from https://github.com/LSSTDESC/SparkCorr.

          <p>We present a new method for the mitigation of observational systematic
effects in angular galaxy clustering via corrective random galaxy catalogues.
Real and synthetic galaxy data, from the Kilo Degree Survey's (KiDS)
4$^{\rm{th}}$ Data Release (KiDS-$1000$) and the Full-sky Lognormal
Astro-fields Simulation Kit (FLASK) package respectively, are used to train
self-organising maps (SOMs) to learn the multivariate relationships between
observed galaxy number density and up to six systematic-tracer variables,
including seeing, Galactic dust extinction, and Galactic stellar density. We
then create `organised' randoms, i.e. random galaxy catalogues with spatially
variable number densities, mimicking the learnt systematic density modes in the
data. Using realistically biased mock data, we show that these organised
randoms consistently subtract spurious density modes from the two-point angular
correlation function $w(\vartheta)$, correcting biases of up to $12\sigma$ in
the mean clustering amplitude to as low as $0.1\sigma$, over a high
signal-to-noise angular range of 7-100 arcmin. Their performance is also
validated for angular clustering cross-correlations in a bright, flux-limited
subset of KiDS-$1000$, comparing against an analogous sample constructed from
highly-complete spectroscopic redshift data. Each organised random catalogue
object is a `clone' carrying the properties of a real galaxy, and is
distributed throughout the survey footprint according to the parent galaxy's
position in systematics-space. Thus, sub-sample randoms are readily derived
from a single master random catalogue via the same selection as applied to the
real galaxies. Our method is expected to improve in performance with increased
survey area, galaxy number density, and systematic contamination, making
organised randoms extremely promising for current and future clustering
analyses of faint samples.

towards A3391 from the hot gas morphology and radio lobe structure of its
central AGN. Many of the extended sources in the field detected by eROSITA are
known clusters or new clusters in the background, including a known SZ cluster

$r_{100}$, of A3391 connecting to the Northern Clump and extending south of

          <p>If primordial black holes (PBHs) formed at the quark-hadron epoch, their mass
must be close to the Chandrasekhar limit, this also being the characteristic
mass of stars. If they provide the dark matter (DM), the collapse fraction must
be of order the cosmological baryon-to-photon ratio $\sim 10^{-9}$, which
suggests a scenario in which a baryon asymmetry is produced efficiently in the
outgoing shock around each PBH and then propagates to the rest of the Universe.
We suggest that the temperature increase in the shock provides the ingredients
for hot spot electroweak baryogenesis. This also explains why baryons and DM
have comparable densities, the precise ratio depending on the size of the PBH
relative to the cosmological horizon at formation. The observed value of the
collapse fraction and baryon asymmetry depends on the amplitude of the
curvature fluctuations which generate the PBHs and may be explained by an
anthropic selection effect associated with the existence of galaxies. We
propose a scenario in which the quantum fluctuations of a light stochastic
spectator field during inflation generate large curvature fluctuations in some
regions, with the stochasticity of this field providing the basis for the
required selection. Finally, we identify several observational predictions of
our scenario that should be testable within the next few years. In particular,
the PBH mass function could extend to sufficiently high masses to explain the
black hole coalescences observed by LIGO/Virgo.

          <p>A universal mechanism may be responsible for several unresolved cosmic
conundra. The sudden drop in the pressure of relativistic matter at
$W^{\pm}/Z^{0}$ decoupling, the quark--hadron transition and $e^{+}e^{-}$
annihilation enhances the probability of primordial black hole (PBH) formation
in the early Universe. Assuming the amplitude of the primordial curvature
fluctuations is approximately scale-invariant, this implies a multi-modal PBH
mass spectrum with peaks at $10^{-6}$, 1, 30, and $10^{6}\,M_{\odot}$. This
suggests a unified PBH scenario which naturally explains the dark matter and
recent microlensing observations, the LIGO/Virgo black hole mergers, the
correlations in the cosmic infrared and X-ray backgrounds, and the origin of
the supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei at high redshift. A distinctive
prediction of our model is that LIGO/Virgo should observe black hole mergers in
the mass gaps between 2 and $5\,M_{\odot}$ (where no stellar remnants are
expected) and above $65\,M_{\odot}$ (where pair-instability supernovae occur)
and low-mass-ratios in between. Therefore the recent detection of events
GW190425, GW190814 and GW190521 with these features is striking confirmation of
our prediction and may indicate a primordial origin for the black holes. In
this case, the exponential sensitivity of the PBH abundance to the equation of
state would offer a unique probe of the QCD phase transition. The detection of
PBHs would also offer a novel way to probe the existence of new particles or
phase transitions with energy between $1\,{\rm MeV}$ and $10^{10}\,$GeV.

          <p>We investigate higher order symplectic integration strategies within Bayesian
cosmic density field reconstruction methods. In particular, we study the
fourth-order discretisation of Hamiltonian equations of motion (EoM). This is
achieved by recursively applying the basic second-order leap-frog scheme
(considering the single evaluation of the EoM) in a combination of even numbers
of forward time integration steps with a single intermediate backward step.
This largely reduces the number of evaluations and random gradient
computations, as required in the usual second-order case for high-dimensional
cases. We restrict this study to the lognormal-Poisson model, applied to a full
volume halo catalogue in real space on a cubical mesh of 1250 $h^{-1}$ Mpc side
and 256$^3$ cells. Hence, we neglect selection effects, redshift space
distortions, and displacements. We note that those observational and cosmic
evolution effects can be accounted for in subsequent Gibbs-sampling steps
within the COSMIC BIRTH algorithm. We find that going from the usual second to
fourth-order in the leap-frog scheme shortens the burn-in phase by a factor of
at least $\sim30$. This implies that 75-90 independent samples are obtained
while the fastest second-order method converges. After convergence, the
correlation lengths indicate an improvement factor of about 3.0 fewer gradient
computations for meshes of 256$^3$ cells. In the considered cosmological
scenario, the traditional leap-frog scheme turns out to outperform higher order
integration schemes only at lower dimensional problems, e.g. meshes with 64$^3$
cells. This gain in computational efficiency can help to go towards a full
Bayesian analysis of the cosmological large-scale structure for upcoming galaxy
surveys.

          <p>Gravitational-wave astronomy provides a unique new way to study the expansion
history of the Universe. In this work, we investigate the impact future
gravitational-wave observatories will have on cosmology. Third-generation
observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will be sensitive
to essentially all of the binary black hole coalescence events in the Universe.
Recent work by \cite{farr2019future} points out that features in the
stellar-mass black hole population break the mass-redshift degeneracy,
facilitating precise determination of the Hubble parameter without
electromagnetic counterparts or host galaxy catalogues. Using a hierarchical
Bayesian inference model, we show that with one year of observations by the
Einstein Telescope, the Hubble constant will be measured to $\lesssim 1\%$. We
also show that this method can be used to perform Bayesian model selection
between cosmological models. As an illustrative example, we find that a
decisive statement can be made comparing the $\Lambda$CDM and RHCT cosmological
models using two weeks of data from the Einstein Telescope.

          <p>We analyse systems analogous to the Milky Way (MW) in the EAGLE cosmological
hydrodynamics simulation in order to deduce the likely structure of the MW's
dark matter halo. We identify MW-mass haloes in the simulation whose satellite
galaxies have similar kinematics and spatial distribution to those of the
bright satellites of the MW, specifically systems in which the majority of the
satellites (8 out of 11) have nearly co-planar orbits that are also
perpendicular to the central stellar disc. We find that the normal to the
common orbital plane of the co-planar satellites is well aligned with the minor
axis of the host dark matter halo, with a median misalignment angle of only
$17.3^\circ$. Based on this result, we infer that the minor axis of the
Galactic dark matter halo points towards $(l,b)=(182^\circ,-2^\circ)$, with an
angular uncertainty at the 68 and 95 percentile confidence levels of 22$^\circ$
and 43$^\circ$ respectively. Thus, the inferred minor axis of the MW halo lies
in the plane of the stellar disc. The halo, however, is not homologous and its
flattening and orientation vary with radius. The inner parts of the halo are
rounder than the outer parts and well-aligned with the stellar disc (that is
the minor axis of the halo is perpendicular to the disc). Further out, the halo
twists and the minor axis changes direction by $90^\circ$. This twist occurs
over a very narrow radial range and reflects variations in the filamentary
network along which mass was accreted into the MW.

          <p>Ultralight scalar dark matter can interact with all massive Standard Model
particles through a universal coupling. Such a coupling modifies the Standard
Model particle masses and affects the dynamics of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We
model the cosmological evolution of the dark matter, taking into account the
modifications of the scalar mass by the environment as well as the full
dynamics of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We find that precision measurements of
the helium-4 abundance set stringent constraints on the available parameter
space, and that these constraints are strongly affected by both the dark matter
environmental mass and the dynamics of the neutron freeze-out. Furthermore, we
perform the analysis in both the Einstein and Jordan frames, the latter of
which allows us to implement the model into numerical Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
codes and analyze additional light elements. The numerical analysis shows that
the constraint from helium-4 dominates over deuterium, and that the effect on
lithium is insufficient to solve the lithium problem. Comparing to several
other probes, we find that Big Bang Nucleosynthesis sets the strongest

$[1.6-2.5]~M_\odot$ and $[2.5-2.7]~M_\odot$ and merging rates $

masses 66 and $85~M_\odot$, and therefore lies in the so-called
pair-instability mass gap, where there should not be direct formation of
stellar black holes. The possibility that all of these objects are Primordial
Black Holes (PBHs) is investigated. The known thermal history of the Universe
predicts that the PBH formation is boosted at the time of the QCD transition,
inducing a peak in their distribution at this particular mass scale, and a bump
around $30-50~M_\odot$. We find that the merging rates inferred from GW190425,
GW190521 and GW190814 are consistent with PBH binaries formed by capture in
dense halos or before matter-radiation equality. At the same time, the rate of
black hole mergers around $30~M_\odot$ and of sub-solar PBH mergers do not
exceed the LIGO/Virgo limits. Such PBHs could explain a significant fraction,
or even the totality of the Dark Matter, but they must be sufficiently strongly
clustered in order to be consistent with current astrophysical limits.

described by a universal probability distribution function (PDF), which is

0.021$. Combining the BAO data with the Cosmic Chronometers data, the Pantheon
Type Ia supernova and the Hubble Diagram of Gamma Ray Bursts and Quasars, the
Hubble constant yields $ 69.85 \pm 1.27 km/sec/Mpc$ and the sound horizon
distance gives: $ 146.1 \pm 2.15 Mpc$. Beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model we test
$\Omega_K$CDM and wCDM. The spatial curvature is $\Omega_k = -0.076 \pm 0.012$
and the dark energy equation of states: $w = -0.989 \pm 0.049$. {We perform AIC
test to compare the 3 models and see that $\Lambda$CDM scores best.

          <p>The NANOGrav pulsar timing array experiment reported evidence for a
stochastic common-spectrum process affecting pulsar timing residuals in its
12.5-year dataset, which might be interpreted as the first detection of a
stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). I examine whether the NANOGrav
signal might be explained by an inflationary SGWB, focusing on the implications
for the tensor spectral index $n_T$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$.
Explaining NANOGrav while complying with upper limits on $r$ from BICEP2/Keck
Array and Planck requires $r \gtrsim {\cal O}(10^{-6})$ in conjunction with an
extremely blue tensor spectrum, $0.7 \lesssim n_T \lesssim 1.3$. After
discussing models which can realize such a blue spectrum, I show that this
region of parameter space can be brought in agreement with Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis constraints for a sufficiently low reheating scale, $T_{\rm rh}
\lesssim 100\,{\rm GeV}-1\,{\rm TeV}$. With the important caveat of having
assumed a power-law parametrization for the primordial tensor spectrum, an
inflationary interpretation of the NANOGrav signal is therefore not excluded.

          <p>We study the statistical mechanics of binary systems under gravitational
interaction of the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) in three-dimensional
space. Considering the binary systems, in the microcanonical and canonical
ensembles, we show that in the microcanonical systems, unlike the Newtonian
gravity, there is a sharp phase transition, with a high-temperature homogeneous
phase and a low temperature clumped binary one. Defining an order parameter in
the canonical systems, we find a smoother phase transition and identify the
corresponding critical temperature in terms of physical parameters of the
binary system. Our results for the binary system provide a hint to understand
the phase transitions in the N-body system by considering it as a constituent
of binary subsystems.

          <p>We investigate in detail a family of quintessential inflation models in the
context of $R+R^2$ Palatini modified gravity. We find that successful inflation
and quintessence are obtained with an inflaton scalar potential that is
approximately quadratic in inflation and inverse quartic in quintessence. We
show that corrections for the kination period due to Palatini modified gravity
are subdominant, while the setup does not challenge constraints on modified
gravity from solar system observations and microscopic experiments, in contrast
to the metric case. We obtain concrete predictions regarding primordial
tensors, to be probed in the near future.
