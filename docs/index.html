          <p>We describe three different methods for exploring the hydrogen reionization
epoch using fast radio bursts (FRBs) and provide arguments for the existence of
FRBs at high redshift (z). The simplest way, observationally, is to determine
the maximum dispersion measure (DM$_{\rm max}$) of FRBs for an ensemble that
includes bursts during the reionization. The DM$_{\rm max}$ provides
information regarding reionization much like the optical depth of the CMB to
Thomson scattering does, and it has the potential to be more accurate than
constraints from Planck, if DM$_{\rm max}$ can be measured to a precision
better than 500 $\mbox{pc cm}^{-3}$. Another method is to measure redshifts of
about 40 FRBs between z of 6-10 with$\sim10\%$ accuracy to obtain the average
electron density in 4 different z-bins with $\sim4\%$ accuracy. These two
methods don't require knowledge of the FRB luminosity function and its possible
redshift evolution. Finally, we show that the reionization history is reflected
in the number of FRBs per unit DM, given a fluence limited survey of FRBs that
includes bursts during the reionization epoch; we show using FIRE simulations
that the contributions to DM from the FRB host galaxy $\&amp;$ CGM during the
reionization era is a small fraction of the observed DM. This third method
requires no redshift information but does require knowledge of the FRB
luminosity function.

          <p>The question of whether Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and
polarization data from Planck favor a spatially closed Universe with curvature
parameter $\Omega_K&lt;0$ has been the subject of recent intense discussions.
Attempts to break the geometrical degeneracy combining Planck data with
external datasets such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements all
point towards a spatially flat Universe, at the cost of significant tensions
with Planck, which make the resulting dataset combination problematic. Settling
this issue would require identifying a dataset which can break the geometrical
degeneracy while not incurring in these tensions. In this work we argue that
cosmic chronometers (CC), measurements of the expansion rate $H(z)$ from the
relative ages of massive early-type passively evolving galaxies, are the
dataset we are after. Furthermore, CC come with the additional advantage of
being virtually free of cosmological model assumptions. Combining Planck 2018
CMB temperature and polarization data with the latest compilation of CC
measurements, we break the geometrical degeneracy and find $\Omega_K=-0.0054
\pm 0.0055$, consistent with a spatially flat Universe and competitive with the
Planck+BAO constraint. After discussing our results in light of the oldest
objects in the Universe, we assess their stability against against minimal
parameter space extensions and CC systematics, finding them to be stable
against both. We find no substantial tension between Planck and CC data within
a non-flat Universe, making the resulting combination reliable. Our results
therefore allow us to assert with confidence that the Universe is indeed
spatially flat to the ${\cal O}(10^{-2})$ level, a finding which might possibly
settle the ongoing spatial curvature debate, and lends even more support to the
already very successful inflationary paradigm.

          <p>Black hole superradiance is a powerful probe of light, weakly-coupled hidden
sector particles. Many candidate particles, such as axions, generically have
self-interactions that can influence the evolution of the superradiant
instability. As pointed out in <a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1604.06422">arXiv:1604.06422</a> in the context of a toy model,
much of the existing literature on spin-0 superradiance does not take into
account the most important self-interaction-induced processes. These processes
lead to energy exchange between quasi-bound levels and particle emission to
infinity; for large self-couplings, superradiant growth is saturated at a
quasi-equilibrium configuration of reduced level occupation numbers. In this
paper, we perform a detailed analysis of the rich dynamics of spin-0
superradiance with self-interactions, and the resulting observational
signatures. We focus on quartic self-interactions, which dominate the evolution
for most models of interest. We explore multiple distinct regimes of parameter
space introduced by a non-zero self-interaction, including the simultaneous
population of two or more bound levels; at large coupling, we confirm the basic
picture of quasi-equilibrium saturation and provide evidence that the
"bosenova" collapse does not occur in most of the astrophysical parameter
space. Compared to gravitational superradiance, we find that gravitational wave
"annihilation" signals and black hole spin-down are parametrically suppressed
with increasing interactions, while new gravitational wave "transition" signals
can take place for moderate interactions. The novel phenomenon of scalar wave
emission is less suppressed at large couplings, and if the particle has
Standard Model interactions, then coherent, monochromatic axion wave signals
from black hole superradiance may be detectable in proposed axion dark matter
experiments.

          <p>We generalize dark matter production to a two-metric framework whereby the
physical metric, which couples to the Standard Model (SM), is conformally
and/or disformally related to the metric governing the gravitational dynamics.
We show that this setup is naturally present in many Ultra Violet (UV)
constructions, from K\"ahler moduli fields to tensor-portal models, and from
emergent gravity to supergravity models. In this setting we study dark matter
production in the early Universe resulting from both scatterings off the
thermal bath and the radiative decay of the inflaton. We also take into account
non-instantaneous reheating effects at the end of inflation. In this context,
dark matter emerges from the production of the scalar field mediating the
conformal/disformal interactions with the SM, i.e. realising a Feebly
Interacting Matter Particle (FIMP) scenario where the suppression scale of the
interaction between the scalar and the SM can be taken almost as high as the

          <p>Despite their ubiquity, there are many open questions regarding galactic and
cosmic magnetic fields. Specifically, current observational constraints cannot
rule out if magnetic fields observed in galaxies were generated in the Early
Universe or are of astrophysical nature. Motivated by this we use our magnetic
tracers algorithm to investigate whether the signatures of primordial magnetic
fields persist in galaxies throughout cosmic time. We simulate a Milky Way-like
galaxy in four scenarios: magnetised solely by primordial magnetic fields,
magnetised exclusively by SN-injected magnetic fields, and two combined
primordial + SN magnetisation cases. We find that once primordial magnetic
fields with a comoving strength $B_0 &gt;10^{-12}$ G are considered, they remain
the primary source of galaxy magnetisation. Our magnetic tracers show that,
even combined with galactic sources of magnetisation, when primordial magnetic
fields are strong, they source the large-scale fields in the warm metal-poor
phase of the simulated galaxy. In this case, the circumgalactic and
intergalactic medium can be used to probe $B_0$ without risk of pollution by
magnetic fields originated in the galaxy. Furthermore, whether magnetic fields
are primordial or astrophysically-sourced can be inferred by studying local gas
metallicity. As a result, we predict that future state-of-the-art observational
facilities of magnetic fields in galaxies will have the potential to unravel
astrophysical and primordial magnetic components of our Universe.

          <p>We propose a new way of studying the Higgs potential at extremely high
energies. The SM Higgs boson, as a light spectator field during inflation in
the early Universe, can acquire large field values from its quantum
fluctuations which vary among different causal (Hubble) patches. Such a space
dependence of the Higgs after the end of inflation leads to space-dependent SM
particle masses and hence variable efficiency of reheating, when the inflaton
decays to Higgsed SM particles. Inhomogeneous reheating results in (observable)
temperature anisotropies. Further, the resulting temperature anisotropy
spectrum acquires a significant non-Gaussian component, which is constrained by
${\it Planck}$ observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and
potentially detectable in next-generation experiments. Hence, in principle,
observational searches for non-Gaussianity in the CMB can be used to constrain
the dynamics of the Higgs boson at very high (inflationary) energies.

$J$-band luminosity functions using a Lorentzian distribution modified to allow

configurations called oscillons. A detailed study of their longevity is
important for understanding their applications in cosmology. In this paper, we
study gravitational effects on the decay rate and lifetime of dense oscillons,
where self-interactions are more or at least equally important compared with
gravitational interactions. As examples, we consider the $\alpha$-attractor
T-model of inflation and the axion monodromy model, where the potentials become
flatter than quadratic at large field values beyond some characteristic field
distance $F$ from the minimum. For oscillons with field amplitudes of
$\mathcal{O}(F)$ and for $F\ll 0.1 M_\mathrm{pl}$, we find that their evolution
is almost identical to cases where gravity is ignored. For $F\sim 0.1

$g$, abundance and equation of state of the ALP to produce the observed
birefringence. Especially when the ALP is responsible for dark energy, it is
possible to probe the tiny deviation of dark energy equation of state from $-1$
through the cosmic birefringence. We also explore ALPs working as early dark
energy (EDE), which alleviates the Hubble tension problem. Since the other
parameters are limited by the EDE requirements, we narrow down the ALP-photon
coupling to $10^{-19}\, {\rm GeV}^{-1}\lesssim g\lesssim 10^{-16}\, {\rm
GeV}^{-1}$ for the decay constant $f=M_\mathrm{pl}$. Therefore, the Hubble
tension and the isotropic birefringence imply that $g$ is typically the order
of $f^{-1}$, which is a non-trivial coincidence.

          <p>We assess comprehensively the potential of galaxy cluster edges as a standard
ruler in measuring cosmological distances and probing exotic physics.
Confronting five alternative cosmological models with cluster edges from the
near future Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey, we conclude that
cluster edges can serve as a promising probe to constrain models beyond
$\Lambda$CDM. Especially, the constraining precision of equation of state of
dark energy from cluster edges is just about two times larger than that from
the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae sample. We find that the constraining power of
cluster edges can be exhibited better by combining it with other probes.
Combining cluster edges with cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic
oscillations, Type Ia supernovae, cosmic chronometers and simulated
gravitational-wave events from the space-based Einstein Telescope,
respectively, we constrain $\Lambda$CDM and find that the data combination of
cosmic microwave background and cluster edges gives the best constraint on the
Hubble constant $H_0$ with a $0.5\%$ precision and the matter density ratio
$\Omega_m$ with a $1.6\%$ precision among these five pair datasets, and that
the data combination of gravitational waves and cluster edges almost shares the
same constraining power as that of Type Ia supernovae and cluster edges. We
also give the most stringent constraint on $\Lambda$CDM by combining cluster
edges with available cosmological data. With the help of other probes, galaxy
cluster edges can give new insights on exotic physics better at cosmological

          <p>We use of the 3+1 formalism of numerical relativity to investigate the
robustness of Starobinsky and Higgs inflation to inhomogeneous initial
conditions, in the form of either field gradient or kinetic energy density.
Sub-Hubble and Hubble-sized fluctuations generically lead to inflation after an
oscillatory phase between gradient and kinetic energies. Hubble-sized
inhomogeneities also produce contracting regions that end up in the formation
of primordial black holes, subsequently diluted by inflation. We analyse the
dynamics of the pre-inflation era and the generation of vector and tensor
fluctuations. Our analysis further supports the robustness of inflation to any
size of inhomogeneity, in the field, velocity or equation-of-state. The
pre-inflation dynamics only marginally depends on the field potential and it is
expected that such behaviour is universal and applies to any inflation
potential of plateau-type, favoured by CMB observations after Planck.

          <p>A logarithm transformation over the matter overdensity field $\delta$ brings
information from the bispectrum and higher-order n-point functions to the power
spectrum. We calculate the power spectrum for the log-transformed field $A$ at
one, two and three loops using perturbation theory (PT). We compare the results
to simulated data and give evidence that the PT series is asymptotic already on
large scales, where the $k$ modes no longer decouple. This motivates us to
build an alternative perturbative series for the log-transformed field that is
not constructed on top of perturbations of $\delta$ but directly over the
equations of motion for $A$ itself. This new approach converges faster and
better reproduces the large scales at low $z$. We then show that the
large-scale behaviour for the log-transformed field power spectrum can be
captured by a small number of free parameters. Finally, we add the
counter-terms expected within the effective field theory framework and show
that the theoretical model, together with the IR-resummation procedure, agrees
with the measured spectrum with percent precision until $k \simeq 0.38 $
Mpc$^{-1}$h at $z=0$. It indicates that the non-linear transformation indeed
linearizes the density field and, in principle, allows us to access information

the evolution of distribution functions (also called as occupation numbers) of
various particles. For the case of the decay of a scalar condensation $\phi$
into a pair of scalar particles (called $\chi$), we point out that the system
may not be well described by the Boltzmann equation when the occupation number
of $\chi$ becomes large even in the so-called narrow resonance regime. We study
the particle production including the possible enhancement due to a large
occupation number of the final state particle, known as the stimulated emission

a set of equations which directly govern the evolution of the distribution
function of $\chi$. Comparing the results of the QFT calculation and those from
the Boltzmann equation, we find non-agreements in some cases. In particular, in
the expanding Universe, the occupation number of $\chi$ based on the QFT may
differ by many orders of magnitude from that from the Boltzmann equation. We
also discuss a possible relation between the evolution equations based on the
QFT and the Boltzmann equation.

with luminally propagating gravitational waves (as extensively discussed in the

observable deviations from General Relativity (GR) in cosmology and the
requirement of radiative stability. Using this as a constraint, we discuss the
subsets of theories that are capable of evading this conclusion and yielding
observable, radiatively stable departures from GR. We find several classes of
theories that can do so, recovering known cases and identifying several
additional radiatively stable cases. Finally, we also extract the cosmological
signatures of two particularly well-motivated radiatively stable classes of
theories: shift-symmetric theories and theories with a conformal coupling
between the scalar and gravity. We find that cosmological parameter constraints

distance and offer a novel measure of the Hubble constant, $H_0$. This
estimation of $H_0$ from standard sirens requires an accurate estimation of the
cosmological redshift of the host galaxy of the GW source, after correcting for
its peculiar velocity. Absence of an accurate peculiar velocity correction
affects both the precision and accuracy of the measurement of $H_0$,
particularly for nearby sources. We propose a framework to incorporate such a

          <p>The use of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) as cosmological tools has motivated
significant effort to: understand what drives the intrinsic scatter of SN Ia
distance modulus residuals after standardization, characterize the distribution
of SN Ia colors, and explain why properties of the host galaxies of the SNe
correlate with SN Ia distance modulus residuals. We use a compiled sample of
$\sim1450$ spectroscopically confirmed, photometric light-curves of SN Ia and
propose a solution to these three problems simultaneously that also explains an
empirical 11$\sigma$ detection of the dependence of Hubble residual scatter on
SN Ia color. We introduce a physical model of color where intrinsic SN Ia
colors with a relatively weak correlation with luminosity are combined with
extrinsic dust-like colors ($E(B-V)$) with a wide range of extinction parameter
values ($R_V$). This model captures the observed trends of Hubble residual
scatter and indicates that the dominant component of SN Ia intrinsic scatter is
from variation in $R_V$. We also find that the recovered $E(B-V)$ and $R_V$
distributions differ based on global host-galaxy stellar mass and this explains
the observed correlation ($\gamma$) between mass and Hubble residuals seen in
past analyses as well as an observed 4.5$\sigma$ dependence of $\gamma$ on SN
Ia color. This finding removes any need to prescribe different intrinsic
luminosities to different progenitor systems. Finally we measure biases in the
equation-of-state of dark energy ($w$) up to $|\Delta w|=0.04$ by replacing
previous models of SN color with our dust-based model; this bias is larger than
any systematic uncertainty in previous SN Ia cosmological analyses.

          <p>Virtually any investigation involving dark matter halos relies on a
definition of their radius, mass, and of whether they are a subhalo. The halo
boundary is most commonly defined to include a spherical overdensity contrast
(such as R200c, Rvir, and R200m), but different thresholds lead to significant
differences in radius and mass. The splashback radius has recently been
suggested as a more physically motivated (and generally larger) halo boundary,
adding to the range of definitions. It is often difficult to assess the impact
of a particular choice because most halo catalogs contain only one or a few
definitions and generally only one set of host-subhalo relations. To alleviate
this issue, we present halo catalogs and merger trees for 14 N-body simulations
of LambdaCDM and self-similar universes. Based on ROCKSTAR catalogs, we compute
additional halo properties using the SPARTA code and recombine them with the
original catalogs. The new catalogs contain numerous variants of spherical
overdensity and splashback radii and masses and, most critically, host-subhalo
relations for each definition. We also present a new merger tree format where
the data is stored as a compressed, two-dimensional matrix. We perform basic
tests of the relation between different definitions and present an updated

          <p>The mass function of dark matter halos is one of the most fundamental
statistics in structure formation. Many theoretical models (such as
Press-Schechter theory) are based on the notion that it could be universal,
meaning independent of redshift and cosmology, when expressed in the
appropriate variables. However, simulations exhibit persistent
non-universalities in the mass functions of the virial mass and other commonly
used spherical overdensity definitions. We systematically study the
universality of mass functions over a wide range of mass definitions, for the
first time including the recently proposed splashback mass, Msp. We confirm
that, in LambdaCDM cosmologies, all mass definitions exhibit varying levels of
non-universality that increase with peak height and reach between 20% and 500%
at the highest masses we can test. Mvir, M200m, and Msp exhibit similar levels
of non-universality. There are, however, two regimes where the splashback mass
functions are significantly more universal. First, they are universal to 10% at
z&lt;2, whereas spherical overdensity definitions experience an evolution due to
dark energy. Second, when additionally considering self-similar cosmologies
with extreme power spectra, splashback mass functions are remarkably universal
(to between 40% and 60%) whereas their spherical overdensity counterparts reach
non-universalities between 180% and 450%. These results strongly support the
notion that the splashback radius is a physically motivated definition of the
halo boundary. We present a simple, universal fitting formula for splashback
mass functions that accurately reproduces our simulation data.

          <p>We present a radio and X-ray analysis of the galaxy cluster SPT-CL
J2032-5627. Investigation of public data from the Australian Square Kilometre
Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) at 943 MHz shows two previously undetected radio
relics at either side of the cluster. For both relic sources we utilise
archival Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) data at 5.5 GHz in
conjunction with the new ASKAP data to determine that both have steep
integrated radio spectra ($\alpha_\mathrm{SE} = -1.52 \pm 0.10$ and
$\alpha_\mathrm{NW,full} = -1.18 \pm 0.10$ for the southeast and northwest
relic sources, respectively). No shock is seen in XMM-Newton observations,
however, the southeast relic is preceded by a cold front in the X-ray emitting
intra-cluster medium. We suggest the lack of a detectable shock may be due to
instrumental limitations, comparing the situation to the southeast relic in
Abell 3667. We compare the relics to the population of double relic sources and
find they are located below the current power-mass ($P$-$M$) scaling relation.
We present an analysis of the low-surface brightness sensitivity of ASKAP and
the ATCA, the excellent sensitivity of both allow the ability to find
heretofore undetected diffuse sources, suggesting these low-power radio relics
will become more prevalent in upcoming large-area radio surveys such as the
Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU).

          <p>We study a recent proposed Ricci-inverse gravity, which is a very novel type
of fourth-order gravity. In particular, we are able to figure out both
isotropically and anisotropically inflating universes to this model. More
interestingly, these solutions are free from a singularity problem. However,
stability analysis based on the dynamical system method shows that both
isotropic and anisotropic inflation of this model turn out to be unstable
against field perturbations. This result indicates that the Ricci-inverse
gravity might not be compatible with the inflationary phase of the universe.

          <p>The NANOGrav Collaboration has recently published a strong evidence for a
stochastic common-spectrum process that may be interpreted as a stochastic
gravitational wave background. We show that such a signal can be explained by
second-order gravitational waves produced during the formation of primordial
black holes from the collapse of sizeable scalar perturbations generated during
inflation. This possibility has two predictions: $i$) the primordial black
holes may comprise the totality of the dark matter with the dominant
contribution to their mass function falling in the range $(10^{-15}\div
10^{-11}) M_\odot$ and $ii$) the gravitational wave stochastic background will
be seen as well by the LISA experiment.

          <p>We examine the evolution of peculiar velocities of arrays of inhomogeneous
cosmic structures in a $\Lambda$CDM background identified as a comoving CMB
frame. These arrays are constructed by smoothly matching to this cosmological
background regions of Szekeres-II models with their imperfect fluid
energy--momentum tensor reinterpreted as non-comoving dust, keeping only first
order terms in $v/c$. We find a peculiar velocity field with magnitudes
compatible with values reported in the literature. We obtain a a contrast of
the Hubble scalar of the same order of magnitude of the current tension on
$H_0$. While the models cannot describe the virialization process, we show
through a representative example that structures of galactic cluster mass reach
the onset of this process at redshifts around $z\sim 3$.
