          <p>The direct detection of gravitational waves offers an exciting new window
onto our Universe. At the same time, multiple observational evidence and
theoretical considerations motivate the presence of physics beyond the Standard
Model. In this thesis, we explore new ways of probing particle physics in the
era of gravitational-wave astronomy. We focus on the signatures of ultralight
bosons on the gravitational waves emitted by binary systems, demonstrating how
binary black holes are novel detectors of this class of dark matter. We also
discuss probes of other types of new physics through their finite-size imprints
on gravitational waveforms, and examine the extent to which current
template-bank searches could be used to detect these signals. In the first two
chapters of this thesis, we review several aspects of gravitational-wave
physics and particle physics at the weak coupling frontier; we hope the reader
would find these reviews helpful in delving further into the literature and in
their research.

          <p>We present a deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging study of two dwarf
galaxies in the halos of Local Volume Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) analogs.
These dwarfs were discovered as part of our Subaru+Hyper Suprime-Cam MADCASH
survey: MADCASH-1, which is a satellite of NGC 2403 (D~3.2 Mpc), and MADCASH-2,
a previously unknown dwarf galaxy near NGC 4214 (D~3.0 Mpc). Our HST data reach
&gt;3.5 mag below the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) of each dwarf, allowing
us to derive their structural parameters and assess their stellar populations.
We measure TRGB distances ($D=3.41^{+0.24}_{-0.23}$ Mpc for MADCASH-1, and
$D=3.00^{+0.13}_{-0.15}$ Mpc for MADCASH-2), and confirm their associations
with their host galaxies. MADCASH-1 is a predominantly old, metal-poor stellar
system (age ~13.5 Gyr, [M/H] ~ -2.0), similar to many Local Group dwarfs.
Modelling of MADCASH-2's CMD suggests that it contains mostly ancient,
metal-poor stars (age ~13.5 Gyr, [M/H] ~ -2.0), but that ~10% of its stellar
mass was formed 1.1--1.5 Gyr ago, and ~1% was formed 400--500 Myr ago. Given
its recent star formation, we search MADCASH-2 for neutral hydrogen using the
Green Bank Telescope, but find no emission and estimate an upper limit on the
HI mass of $&lt;4.8\times10^4 M_{\odot}$. These are the faintest dwarf satellites
known around host galaxies of LMC mass outside the Local Group
($M_{V,\text{MADCASH-1}}=-7.81\pm0.18$, $M_{V,\text{MADCASH-2}}=-9.15\pm0.12$),
and one of them shows signs of recent environmental quenching by its host. Once
the MADCASH survey for faint dwarf satellites is complete, our census will
enable us to test CDM predictions for hierarchical structure formation, and
discover the physical mechanisms by which low-mass hosts influence the
evolution of their satellites.

          <p>The discovery of quasars at $z \gtrsim$ 7 poses serious challenges because it
is not known how 10$^9$ \Ms\ black holes formed by this epoch. The leading
candidates for the seeds of these quasars are 10$^5$ \Ms\ direct-collapse black
holes forming in atomically cooled haloes at $z \sim$ 15 - 20. However, the
Lyman-Werner (LW) UV backgrounds required to form such objects are extreme,
$\gtrsim$ 10$^4$ $\rm J_{21}$, and may have been rare in the early universe.
Here, we model the formation of Population III stars in moderate LW backgrounds
of 100 and 500 $\rm J_{21}$ that were much more common at early times. We find
that these backgrounds allow haloes to grow to a few 10$^6$ - 10$^7$ \Ms\ and
virial temperatures of nearly 10$^4$ K before collapsing but do not completely
sterilize them of H$_2$. At the onset of collapse, Ly$\alpha$ cooling dominates
in the outer regions of the halo but H$_2$ cooling regulates the collapse of
the core, at rates that are 10 - 50 times those in minihaloes because of higher
virial temperatures. Supercharged H$_2$ cooling leads to the formation of 1800
- 2800 \Ms\ primordial stars, with radiative feedback from the star halting
accretion and setting its upper limit in mass. Such stars may lead to a
population of less-massive, lower luminosity quasars that could be discovered
by the {\em James Webb Space Telescope}, {\em Euclid} and the {\em Roman Space
Telescope} in the coming decade.

          <p>The extragalactic background light is comprised of the cumulative radiation
from all galaxies across the history of the universe. The angular power
spectrum of the anisotropies of such a background at near-infrared (IR)
frequencies lacks of a complete understanding and shows a robust excess which
cannot be easily explained with known sources. Dark matter in the form of
axion-like particles (ALPs) with a mass around the electronvolt will decay into
two photons with wavelengths in the near-IR band, possibly contributing to the
background intensity. We compute the near-IR background angular power spectrum
including emissions from galaxies, as well as the contributions from the
intra-halo light and ALP decay, and compare it to measurements from the Hubble
Space Telescope and Spitzer. We find that the preferred values for the ALP mass

Lyman-alpha (Ly-{\alpha}) forest data sets as well as the observed number of
Milky Way (MW) subhalos. We compare results obtained using Maxwell-Boltzmann
and quantum statistics for describing the SM bath. It should be emphasized that
the presence of logarithmic divergences complicates the calculation of the
production rate, which can not be parameterized with a simple power law
behaviour. The obtained results, in combination with X-ray bounds, exclude the
possibility for a photophilic "frozen-in" ALP DM with mass below $\sim
19\,\mathrm{keV}$. For the photophobic ALP scenario, in which DM couples
primarily to SM fermions, the ALP DM distribution function is peaked at
somewhat lower momentum and hence for such realization we find weaker limits on
DM mass. Future facilities, such as the upcoming Vera C. Rubin observatory,
will provide measurements with which the current bounds can be significantly
improved to $\sim 80\,\mathrm{keV}$.

          <p>Upcoming galaxy surveys and 21-cm experiments targeting high redshifts
$z\gtrsim 6$ are highly complementary probes of galaxy formation and
reionization. However, in order to expedite the large volume simulations
relevant for 21-cm observations, many models of galaxies within reionization
codes are entirely subgrid and/or rely on halo abundances only. In this work,
we explore the extent to which resolving and modeling individual galaxy
formation histories affects predictions both for the galaxy populations
accessible to upcoming surveys and the signatures of reionization accessible to
upcoming 21-cm experiments. We find that a common approach, in which galaxy
luminosity is assumed to be a function of halo mass only, is biased with
respect to models in which galaxy properties are evolved through time via
semi-analytic modeling and thus reflective of the diversity of assembly
histories that naturally arise in $N$-body simulations. The diversity of galaxy
formation histories also results in scenarios in which the brightest galaxies
do \textit{not} always reside in the centers of large ionized regions, as there
are often relatively low-mass halos undergoing dramatic, but short-term,
growth. This has clear implications for attempts to detect or validate the
21-cm background via cross correlation. Finally, we show that a hybrid approach
-- in which only halos hosting galaxies bright enough to be detected in surveys
are modeled in detail, with the rest modeled as an unresolved field of halos
with abundance related to large-scale overdensity -- is a viable way to
generate large-volume `simulations` well-suited to wide-area surveys and
current-generation 21-cm experiments targeting relatively large $k \lesssim 1 \
h \ \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ scales.

topological configurations: global monopoles realized by Goldstone fields
winding around the core of false vacuum. One may expect them to behave as
heavy, big composite objects, difficult to make and therefore mostly harmless.
However, after gravity is turned on, as long as Equivalence Principle holds,
one finds that the global monopoles have a negative mass, $M \sim -
\eta/\sqrt{\lambda}$, where $\lambda$ is the field theory coupling. The
negative mass global monopoles could catalyze a flat space instability by the
production of global monopole-antimonopole pairs along with normal particles,

$\omega$ Cen provides a unique opportunity to directly and geometrically
calibrate the luminosity of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) because it
is the only cluster with sufficient mass to provide enough red giant stars,
more than 100 one magnitude below the tip, for a precise, model-free
measurement of the tip. Combined with the pre-existing and most widely-used
measurements of the tip and foreground Milky Way extinction, we find
$M_{I,TRGB}=-3.97\pm0.06$ mag for the $I$-band luminosity of the blue edge.
Using the TRGB luminosity calibrated from the Gaia EDR3 parallax of $\omega$

          <p>Context. A significant fraction of the predicted baryons remains undetected
in the local universe. We adopted the common assumption that a large fraction
of the missing baryons corresponds to the hot (log T(K) = 5.5-7) phase of the
Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). We base our missing baryons search on the
scenario whereby the WHIM has been heated up via accretion shocks and galactic
outflows, and is concentrated towards the filaments of the Cosmic Web.
</p>
<p>Aims. Our aim is to improve the observational search of the poorly detected
hot WHIM.
</p>
<p>Methods. We detect the filamentary structure within the EAGLE simulation by
applying the Bisous formalism to the galaxy distribution. In addition, we use
the MMF/NEXUS+ classification of the large scale environment of the dark matter
component in EAGLE. We then study the spatio-thermal distribution of the hot
baryons within the extracted filaments.
</p>
<p>Results. While the filaments occupy only 5% of the full simulation volume,
the diffuse hot intergalactic medium in filaments amounts to 23% $-$ 25% of the
total baryon budget, or 79% $-$ 87% of all the hot WHIM. The most optimal
filament sample, with a missing baryon mass fraction of 82%, is obtained by
selecting Bisous filaments with a high galaxy luminosity density. For these
filaments we derived analytic formulae for the radial gas density and
temperature profiles, consistent with recent Planck SZ and CMB lensing
observations within the central $r$~ 1 Mpc.
</p>
<p>Conclusions. Results from EAGLE suggest that the missing baryons are strongly
concentrated towards the filament axes. Since the filament finding methods used
here are applicable to galaxy surveys, a large fraction of the missing baryons
can be localised by focusing the observational efforts on the central 1 Mpc
regions of the filaments. Moreover, focusing on high galaxy luminosity density
regions will optimise the observational signal.

          <p>This paper introduces SMACC -- Subhalo Mass-loss Analysis using Core
Catalogs. SMACC adds a mass model to substructure merger trees based on halo
"core tracking." Our approach avoids the need for running expensive subhalo
finding algorithms and instead uses subhalo mass-loss modeling to assign masses
to halo cores. We present details of the SMACC methodology and demonstrate its
excellent performance in describing halo substructure and its evolution.
Validation of the approach is carried out using cosmological simulations at
significantly different resolutions. We apply SMACC to the 1.24
trillion-particle Last Journey simulation and construct core catalogs with the
additional mass information. These catalogs can be readily used as input to
semi-analytic models or subhalo abundance matching approaches to determine
approximate galaxy distributions, as well as for in-depth studies of
small-scale structure evolution.

compilation of X-ray and UV flux measurements of 2038 quasars (QSOs) which span
the redshift range $0.009 \leq z \leq 7.5413$. We find, for the full QSO data

used to standardized these QSOs depend on the cosmological model used to
determine these parameters, i.e, it appears that the full QSO data set include
QSOs that are not standardized and so cannot be used for the purpose of
constraining cosmological parameters. Subsets of the QSO data, restricted to
redshifts $z \lesssim 1.5-1.7$ obey the $L_X-L_{UV}$ relation in a
cosmological-model-independent manner, and so can be used to constrain
cosmological parameters. The cosmological constraints from these lower-$z$,
smaller QSO data subsets are mostly consistent with, but significantly weaker
than, those that follow from baryon acoustic oscillation and Hubble parameter
measurements.

          <p>Conventional algorithms for galaxy power spectrum estimation measure the true
spectrum convolved with a survey window function, which, for parameter
inference, must be compared with a similarly convolved theory model. In this
work, we directly estimate the unwindowed power spectrum multipoles using
quadratic estimators akin to those introduced in the late 1990s. Under Gaussian
assumptions, these are optimal and free from the leading-order effects of
pixellization and non-Poissonian shot-noise. They may be straightforwardly
computed given the survey data-set and a suite of simulations of known
cosmology. We implement the pixel-based maximum-likelihood estimator and a
simplification based on the FKP weighting scheme, both of which can be computed
via FFTs and conjugate gradient descent methods. Furthermore, the estimators
allow direct computation of spectrum coefficients in an arbitrary linear
compression scheme, without needing to first bin the statistico. Applying the
technique to a subset of the BOSS DR12 galaxies, we find that the pixel-based
quadratic estimators give statistically consistent power spectra, compressed
coefficients, and cosmological parameters to those obtained with the usual
windowed approaches. Due to the sample's low number density and compact window
function, the optimal weighting scheme gives little improvement over the
simplified form; this may change for dense surveys or those focusing on
primordial non-Gaussianity. The technique is shown to be efficient and robust,
and shows significant potential for measuring the windowless power spectrum and
bispectrum in the presence of weak non-Gaussianity.

          <p>We develop in this thesis the principles governing the production of our
universe's primordial inhomogeneities during its early phase of inflation. As a
guiding thread we ask what physics during inflation can lead to perturbations
so large that they form black holes in sufficient abundance to be the dark
matter. We start with the simplest single-field slow-roll paradigm for
inflation, which cannot produce primordial black hole dark matter, and then
gradually relieve its assumptions. After developing the effective field theory
of inflation, we highlight the importance of the single-clock condition in
controlling the inhomogeneities. Going beyond single-clock inflation takes us
first to a qualitatively different inflationary scenario known as ultra-slow
roll and finally to understanding the physics of the Higgs field during
inflation.

          <p>Whilst the need for dark matter was established almost a century ago, only
its gravitational interaction has been confirmed so far, allowing for plethora
of models for dark matter. The Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs)
category has received by far the biggest attention, however despite the
enormous experimental efforts, these particles remain elusive. The attention of
the community has hence moved on to investigate the dark matter landscape over
a much larger number of models with varying degrees of resemblances and
differences in their predictions. This calls for the need to organise the
various facets of dark matter models and their signatures, in order to maximise
the experimental sensitivity and to select the models which are compatible with
existing data. In this paper, I provide a short review of the most widespread
public codes capable of computing dark matter observables. In particular, I
discuss what is the status of each numerical tool in terms of: (i) capturing
the WIMP phenomenology and (ii) accounting for new trend dark sector models
that might be weakly coupled to ordinary matter and/or be strongly
self-interacting. This short review has the aim of guiding the user towards
selecting the best suited public code to confront his/her model with the
largest variety of theoretical predictions and experimental data in order to
determine the parameter space consistent with observations for his/her

          <p>Quantifying tensions -- inconsistencies amongst measurements of cosmological
parameters by different experiments -- has emerged as a crucial part of modern
cosmological data analysis. Statistically-significant tensions between two
experiments or cosmological probes may indicate new physics extending beyond
the standard cosmological model and need to be promptly identified. We apply
several tension estimators proposed in the literature to the Dark Energy Survey
(DES) large-scale structure measurement and Planck cosmic microwave background
data. We first evaluate the responsiveness of these metrics to an input tension
artificially introduced between the two, using synthetic DES data. We then
apply the metrics to the comparison of Planck and actual DES Year 1 data. We
find that the parameter differences, Eigentension, and Suspiciousness metrics
all yield similar results on both simulated and real data, while the Bayes
ratio is inconsistent with the rest due to its dependence on the prior volume.
Using these metrics, we calculate the tension between DES Year 1 $3\times 2$pt
and Planck, finding the surveys to be in $\sim 2.3\sigma$ tension under the
$\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This suite of metrics provides a toolset for robustly
testing tensions in the DES Year 3 data and beyond.

          <p>We introduce a general statistical method for estimating first-order magnetic
field fluctuations generated from primordial black hole (PBH) populations. To
that end, we consider monochromatic and extended Press-Schechter PBH mass
functions for different formation scenarios, such that each constituent is
capable of producing its own magnetic field due to some given physical
mechanism. Assuming the simplest linear correlation between magnetic field
fluctuations and matter over-densities, our estimates depend on the mass
function, on the physical field generation mechanism by each PBH constituent,
and on a certain PBH characteristic distance which is also introduced in this
work. After studying the statistics of magnetic field fluctuations by defining
the corresponding magnetic power spectrum, we apply our general formalism to
study the plausibility that two particular field generation mechanisms could
have given rise to the expected seed fields according to current observational
constraints. The first example is the Biermann battery as a prominent
primordial seed field generation candidate, and the second one is due to the
accretion of magnetic monopoles at PBH formation, constituting magnetic PBHs.
Our results show that, for monochromatic distributions, it does not seem to be
possible to generate sufficiently intense seed fields in any of the two field
generation mechanisms explored here. For extended distributions, it is also not
possible to generate the required seed field by only assuming a Biermann
battery mechanism. In fact, we report an average seed field by this mechanism
of about 10^{-47} G, at z = 20. For the case of magnetic monopoles we instead
assume that the seed values from the literature are achieved and calculate the
necessary number density of monopoles. In this case we obtain values that are
below the upper limits from current constraints.

          <p>Non-Gaussian cosmic shear statistics based on weak-lensing aperture mass
($M_{\rm ap}$) maps can outperform the classical shear two-point correlation
function ($\gamma$-2PCF) in terms of cosmological constraining power. Reaching
the full potential of these new estimators however requires an accurate
modeling of the physics of baryons as the extra non-Gaussian information mostly
reside at small scales. We present one such modeling based on the Magneticum
hydrodynamical simulation for the KiDS-450, DES-Y1, and a Euclid-like surveys.
We compute the bias due to baryons on the lensing PDF and the distribution of
peaks and voids in $M_{\rm ap}$ maps and propagate it to the cosmological
forecasts on the structure growth parameter $S_8$, the matter density parameter
$\Omega_{\rm m}$ and the dark energy equation of state $w_0$, using the SLICS
and cosmo-SLICS sets of dark matter only simulations. We report a negative bias
of a few percents on $S_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and also measure a positive
bias of the same level on $w_0$ when including a tomographic decomposition.
These biases are increased to the order of $\sim 5$% when combining $M_{\rm
ap}$ statistics with the $\gamma$-2PCF as these estimators show similar
dependency on the AGN feedback. We verify that these biases constitute less
than a $1\sigma$ shift on the probed cosmological parameters for current cosmic
shear surveys. Baryons, however, need to be accounted for at the percent level
for future Stage IV surveys and we propose to include uncertainty on the AGN
feedback amplitude by marginalizing over this parameter using multiple
simulations such as those presented in this paper. Finally, we explore the
possibility of mitigating the impact of baryons by filtering the $M_{\rm ap}$
map but find that this process would require to suppress the small-scale
information to a point where the constraints would no longer be competitive.

          <p>When the Dark Matter mass is below the eV-scale, its cosmological occupation
number exceeds the ones of photons from the cosmic microwave background as well
as of relic neutrinos. If such Dark Matter decays to pairs of neutrinos, it
implies that experiments that seek the detection of the cosmic neutrino
background may as well be sensitive to this additional form of "dark
radiation". Here we study the prospects for detection taking into account
various options for the forecasted performance of the future PTOLEMY

Matter decays with lifetime as large as $10^4$ Gyr or a sub-% Dark Matter

distinct spectral event shape that is introduced from galactic and cosmological

          <p>In the quest for unification of the Standard Model with gravity, classical
scale invariance can be utilized to dynamically generate the Planck mass
$M_\mathrm{Pl}$. Then, the relation of Planck scale physics to the scale of
electroweak symmetry breaking $\mu_H$ requires further explanation. In this
paper, we propose a model that uses the spontaneous breaking of scale
invariance in the scalar sector as a unified origin for dynamical generation of
both scales. Using the Gildener-Weinberg approximation, only one scalar
acquires a vacuum expectation value of $v_S \sim (10^{16-17})\,\mathrm{GeV}$,
thus radiatively generating $M_\mathrm{Pl} \approx \beta_S^{1/2} v_S$ and
$\mu_H$ via the neutrino option with right handed neutrino masses $m_N = y_M
v_S \sim 10^7 \,\mathrm{GeV}$. Consequently, active SM neutrinos are given a
mass with the inclusion of a type-I seesaw mechanism. Furthermore, we adopt an
unbroken $Z_2$ symmetry and a $Z_2$-odd set of right-handed Majorana neutrinos
$\chi$ that do not take part in the neutrino option and are able to produce the
correct dark matter relic abundance (dominantly) via inflaton decay. The model
also describes cosmic inflation and the inflationary CMB observables are
predicted to interpolate between those of $R^2$ and linear chaotic inflationary
model and are thus well within the strongest experimental constraints.

          <p>Migdal effect provides a new way to search for sub-GeV dark matter. However,
due to the limitation of the energy of ionization and/or de-excitation of the
intrinsic atomic electron state, the current limits on light DM exist in the
mass range of ${\cal O}(10)~{\rm MeV}&lt; m_\chi &lt; {\cal O}(1)~{\rm GeV}$. On the
other hand, since the ionization form factor in Migdal effects can be enhanced
by large momentum transfer, the resulting event rate of S2 signal may be
increased for fast-moving DM, and then improves the bounds on light DM. As a
proof-of concept, we consider a fast-moving sub-GeV DM, namely atmospheric DM
(ADM), which is produced by the interaction between high energy cosmic rays
(CRs) and the atmosphere. With Xenon1T data, we find that there will be nearly
three orders of magnitude improvement on the DM-nucleus scattering cross
section by including Migdal effect.

          <p>We consider a non-Abelian dark SU(2)$_{\rm D}$ model where the dark sector
couples to the Standard Model (SM) through a Higgs portal. We investigate two
different scenarios of the dark sector scalars with $Z_2$ symmetry, with Higgs
portal interactions that can introduce mixing between the SM Higgs boson and
the SM singlet scalars in the dark sector. We utilize the existing collider
results of the Higgs signal rate, direct heavy Higgs searches, and electroweak
precision observables to constrain the model parameters. The
$\text{SU(2)}_{\text{D}}$ partially breaks into $\text{U(1)}_{\text{D}}$ gauge
group by the scalar sector. The resulting two stable massive dark gauge bosons
and pseudo-Goldstone bosons can be viable cold dark matter candidates, while
the massless gauge boson from the unbroken $\text{U(1)}_{\text{D}}$ subgroup is
a dark radiation and can introduce long-range attractive dark matter (DM)
self-interaction, which can alleviate the small-scale structure issues. We
study in detail the pattern of strong first-order phase transition and
gravitational wave (GW) production triggered by the dark sector symmetry
breaking, and further evaluate the signal-to-noise ratio for several proposed
space interferometer missions. We conclude that the rich physics in the dark
sector may be observable with the current and future measurements at colliders,
DM experiments, and GW interferometers.

relevant bias operators at that order and leading order in derivatives. The

subpercent agreement up to scales of $k\sim 0.2 h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We also

scale structure by boosting density perturbations on small scales. We study the
capability of Pulsar Timing Arrays to search for, and constrain, subhalos from
such models. The models of DM we consider are ordinary adiabatic perturbations
in $\Lambda$CDM, QCD axion miniclusters, models with early matter domination,
and vector DM produced during inflation. We show that $\Lambda$CDM, largely due
to tidal stripping effects in the Milky Way, is out of reach for PTAs (as well
as every other probe proposed to detect DM small scale structure). Axion
miniclusters may be within reach, although this depends crucially on whether
the axion relic density is dominated by the misalignment or string
contribution. Models where there is matter domination with a reheat temperature
below 1 GeV may be observed with future PTAs. Lastly, vector DM produced during
inflation can be detected if it is lighter than $10^{-16} \,{\rm GeV}$. We also
make publicly available a Python Monte Carlo tool for generating the PTA time
delay signal from any model of DM substructure.

General Relativity. We use a broad subclass of Horndeski scalar-tensor theories

deviations and their degeneracies with other cosmological parameters. Our
analysis includes relativistic effects, does not rely on the quasi-static

show how the combination of different types of surveys, probing different
length scales and redshifts, can be used to pin down constraints on the

simulating the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) absorption optical depth in presence
of neutral hydrogen "islands" left over from reionization at redshifts $5

semi-numerical photon-conserving model of ionized regions during reionization
(named SCRIPT) along with a prescription for simulating the shadowing by
neutral islands and (ii) the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation to model
the Ly$\alpha$ absorption. Our model is then used for simulating the
large-scale fluctuations in the effective optical depth as observed along sight
lines towards high$-z$ quasars. Our model is fully described by five
parameters. By setting two of them to default values and varying the other
three, we obtain the constraints on reionization history at $5 \lesssim z
\lesssim 6$ as allowed by the data. We confirm that reionization is \emph{not}
complete before $z \sim 5.6$ at $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ confidence, with the exact
confidence limits depending on how the non-detections of the flux in the data
are treated. We also confirm that the completion of reionization can be as late
as $z \sim 5.2$. With further improvements in the model and with more sight
lines at $z \sim 6$, we can take advantage of the computational efficiency of
our analysis to obtain more stringent constraints on the ionization fraction at
the tail-end of reionization.

it is usually modelled as a Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)
space-time. The non-linearity of the Einstein field equations raises concern
over averaging over small-scale deviations form homogeneity and isotropy, with
possible implications on the applicability of the FLRW metric to the Universe,
even on large scales. Here I present a technique, based on the multiple-scales
method of singular perturbation theory, to handle the small-scale
inhomogeneities consistently. I obtain a leading order effective Einstein
equation for the large-scale space-time metric, which contains a back-reaction
term. The derivation relies on a series of consistency conditions, that ensure
that the growth of deviations from the large-scale space-time metric do not
grow unboundedly; criteria for their satisfiability are discussed, and it is
shown that they are indeed satisfied if matter is non-relativistic on small
scales. The analysis is performed in harmonic gauge, and conversion to other
gauges is discussed. I estimate the magnitude of the back-reaction term
relative to the critical density of the Universe in the example of an NFW halo,
and find it to be of the order of a few percent. In this example, the
back-reaction term is interpreted as a contribution of the energy-density of

          <p>The knowledge of the dynamical state of galaxy clusters allows to alleviate
systematics when observational data from these objects are applied in
cosmological studies. Evidence of correlation between the state and the
morphology of the clusters is well studied. The morphology can be inferred by
images of the surface brightness in the X-ray band and of the thermal component
of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect in the millimetre range. For this
purpose, we apply, for the first time, the Zernike polynomial decomposition, a
common analytic approach mostly used in adaptive optics to recover aberrated
radiation wavefronts at the telescopes pupil plane. With this novel way we
expect to correctly infer the morphology of clusters and so possibly, their
dynamical state. To verify the reliability of this new approach we use more
than 300 synthetic clusters selected in THE THREE HUNDRED project at different
redshifts ranging from 0 up to 1.03. Mock maps of the tSZ, quantified with the
Compton parameter, $y$-maps, are modelled with Zernike polynomials inside
$R_{500}$, the cluster reference radius. We verify that it is possible to
discriminate the morphology of each cluster by estimating the contribution of
the different polynomials to the fit of the map. The results of this new method
are correlated with those of a previous analysis made on the same catalogue,
using two parameters that combine either morphological or dynamical-state
probes. We underline that instrumental angular resolution of the maps has an
impact mainly when we extend this approach to high-redshift clusters.

        <strong>Implications of Gravitational-wave Production from Dark Photon Resonance to Pulsar-timing Observations and Effective Number of Relativistic Species. (arXiv:2009.13909v3 [astro-ph.CO] UPDATED)</strong>

          <p>The coherent oscillation of axionic fields naturally drives copious
production of dark photon particles in the early universe, due to resonance and
tachyonic enhancement. During the process, energy is abruptly transferred from
the former to the latter, sourcing gravitational wave generation. The resulting
gravitational waves are eventually to be observed as stochastic background
today. We report analytical results of this production and connect them to the
recent pulsar-timing results by the NANOGrav collaboration. We show an
available parameter space, around the mass $m_\phi \sim 10^{-13} \, {\rm eV}$
and the decay constant $f_\phi \sim 10^{16} \, {\rm GeV}$ with a dimensionless
coupling of ${\cal O}(1)$, for our mechanism to account for the signal. A
mechanism to avoid the axion over-dominating the universe is a necessary
ingredient of this model, and we discuss a possibility to recover a symmetry
and render the axion massless after the production. We also comment on
potential implications of the required effective number of relativistic species
to the determination of the present Hubble constant.

          <p>Cross-correlations between the lensing of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) and other tracers of large-scale structure provide a unique way to
reconstruct the growth of dark matter, break degeneracies between cosmology and
galaxy physics, and test theories of modified gravity. We detect a
cross-correlation between DESI-like luminous red galaxies (LRGs) selected from
DECaLS imaging and CMB lensing maps reconstructed with the Planck satellite at
a significance of $S/N = 27.2$ over scales $\ell_{\rm min} = 30$, $\ell_{\rm
max} = 1000$. To correct for magnification bias, we determine the slope of the
LRG cumulative magnitude function at the faint limit as $s = 0.999 \pm 0.015$,
and find corresponding corrections on the order of a few percent for $C^{\kappa
g}_{\ell}, C^{gg}_{\ell}$ across the scales of interest. We fit the large-scale
galaxy bias at the effective redshift of the cross-correlation $z_{\rm eff}
\approx 0.68$ using two different bias evolution agnostic models: a HaloFit
times linear bias model where the bias evolution is folded into the
clustering-based estimation of the redshift kernel, and a Lagrangian
perturbation theory model of the clustering evaluated at $z_{\rm eff}$. We also
determine the error on the bias from uncertainty in the redshift distribution;
within this error, the two methods show excellent agreement with each other and
with DESI survey expectations.

          <p>We study the effect of dark matter (DM) being encapsulated in primordial
black holes (PBHs) on the power spectrum of density fluctuations $P(k)$; we
also look at its effect on the abundance of haloes and their clustering. We
allow the growth of Poisson fluctuations since matter and radiation equality
and study both monochromatic and extended PBH mass distributions. We present
updated monochromatic black hole mass constraints by demanding $&lt;10\%$
deviations from the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter power spectrum at a scale of
$k=1$hMpc$^{-1}$. Our results show that PBHs with masses $&gt;10^4$h$^{-1}M_\odot$
are excluded from conforming all of the dark matter in the Universe. We also
apply this condition to our extended Press-Schechter (PS) mass functions, and
find that the Poisson power is scale dependent even before applying evolution,
due to the change of the mass density in PBHs with redshift, and therefore with
scale, as they start affecting the gravitational potential at different times.
We find that characteristic masses $M^*\leq10^2 $h$^{-1}M_\odot$ are allowed,
{leaving only two characteristic PBH mass windows of PS mass functions when
combining with previous constraints, at $M^*\sim10^2$h$^{-1}M_\odot$ and
$\sim10^{-8}$h$^{-1}M_\odot$ where all of the DM can be in PBHs. The resulting
dark matter halo mass functions within these windows are similar} to those
resulting from cold dark matter made of fundamental particles, but as soon as
the parameters produce unrealistic $P(k)$, the resulting halo mass functions
and their bias as a function of halo mass deviate strongly from the behaviour
measured in the real Universe.

          <p>We present MADLens a python package for producing non-Gaussian lensing
convergence maps at arbitrary source redshifts with unprecedented precision.
MADLens is designed to achieve high accuracy while keeping computational costs
as low as possible. A MADLens simulation with only $256^3$ particles produces
convergence maps whose power agree with theoretical lensing power spectra up to
$L{=}10000$ within the accuracy limits of HaloFit. This is made possible by a
combination of a highly parallelizable particle-mesh algorithm, a sub-evolution
scheme in the lensing projection, and a machine-learning inspired sharpening
step. Further, MADLens is fully differentiable with respect to the initial
conditions of the underlying particle-mesh simulations and a number of
cosmological parameters. These properties allow MADLens to be used as a forward
model in Bayesian inference algorithms that require optimization or
derivative-aided sampling. Another use case for MADLens is the production of
large, high resolution simulation sets as they are required for training novel
deep-learning-based lensing analysis tools. We make the MADLens package
