          <p>The Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) is the first large-area survey to be
conducted with the full 36-antenna Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder
(ASKAP) telescope. RACS will provide a shallow model of the ASKAP sky that will
aid the calibration of future deep ASKAP surveys. RACS will cover the whole sky
visible from the ASKAP site in Western Australia, and will cover the full ASKAP
band of $700-1800$ MHz. The RACS images are generally deeper than the existing
NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) and Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS)
radio surveys and have better spatial resolution. All RACS survey products will
be public, including radio images (with $\sim 15$ arcsecond resolution) and
catalogues of about three million source components with spectral index and
polarisation information. In this paper, we present a description of the RACS
survey and the first data release of 903 images covering the sky south of
declination $+41^\circ$ made over a 288 MHz band centred at 887.5 MHz.

          <p>The north ecliptic pole (NEP) field is a natural deep field location for many
satellite observations. It has been targeted manytimes since it was surveyed by
the AKARI space telescope with its unique wavelength coverage from the near- to
mid-infrared(mid-IR). Many follow-up observations have been carried out and
made this field one of the most frequently observed areas witha variety of
facilities, accumulating abundant panchromatic data from X-ray to radio
wavelength range. Recently, a deep opticalsurvey with the Hyper Suprime-Cam

us toidentify faint sources in the near- and mid-IR bands, and to improve the
photometric redshift (photo-z) estimation. In this work,we present newly
identified AKARI sources by the HSC survey, along with multi-band photometry
for 91,861 AKARI sourcesobserved over the NEPW field. We release a new
band-merged catalogue combining various photometric data from GALEXUV to the
submillimetre (sub-mm) bands (e.g., Herschel/SPIRE, JCMT/SCUBA-2). About 20,000
AKARI sources are newlymatched to the HSC data, most of which seem to be faint

within ~20 Mpc. Combined with the PHANGS-ALMA, PHANGS-MUSE surveys and other
multiwavelength data, the dataset will provide an unprecedented look into the
connections between young stars, HII regions, and cold molecular gas in these
nearby star-forming galaxies. Accurate distances are needed to transform
measured observables into physical parameters (e.g., brightness to luminosity,
angular to physical sizes of molecular clouds, star clusters and associations).
PHANGS-HST has obtained parallel ACS imaging of the galaxy halos in the F606W
and F814W bands. Where possible, we use these parallel fields to derive tip of
the red giant branch (TRGB) distances to these galaxies. In this paper, we
present TRGB distances for 11 galaxies from ~4 to ~15 Mpc, based on the first
year of PHANGS-HST observations. Five of these represent the first published
TRGB distance measurements (IC 5332, NGC 2835, NGC 4298, NGC 4321, and NGC

also provide a compilation of distances for the 118 galaxies in the full PHANGS

          <p>The nature of dark matter is a longstanding mystery in cosmology, which can
be studied with laboratory or collider experiments, as well as astrophysical
and cosmological observations. In this work, we propose realistic and efficient
strategies to detect radiative products from dark-matter decays with
line-intensity mapping (LIM) experiments. This radiation will behave as a line
interloper for the atomic and molecular spectral lines targeted by LIM surveys.
The most distinctive signatures of the contribution from dark-matter radiative
decays are an extra anisotropy on the LIM power spectrum due to projection
effects, as well as a narrowing and a shift towards higher intensities of the
voxel intensity distribution. We forecast the minimum rate of decays into two
photons that LIM surveys will be sensitive to as function of the dark-matter
mass in the range $\sim 10^{-6}-10$ eV, and discuss how to reinterpret such
results for dark matter that decays into a photon and another particle. We find
that both the power spectrum and the voxel intensity distribution are expected
to be very sensitive to the dark-matter contribution, with the voxel intensity
distribution being more promising for most experiments considered. Interpreting
our results in terms of the axion, we show that LIM surveys will be extremely
competitive to detect its decay products, improving several orders of
magnitudes (depending on the mass) the sensitivity of laboratory and
astrophysical searches, especially in the mass range $\sim 1-10$ eV.

measuring metal absorption through quasar absorption spectrum stacking as a
function distance to closest quasar in SDSS-IV/eBOSS on 10s of comoving
megaparsec scales. We study both intergalactic medium absorbers and mixed
circumgalactic medium absorbers and probe absorption in O VI, C IV, and Si IV,
and Si III. Overall stronger high ionization species absorption is seen closer
to quasars at $2.4&lt;z&lt;3.1$. O VI absorption shows a particularly strong change,
with effects in C IV evident in some cases, and more marginal effects in Si III
and Si IV. We further study $2.05&lt;z&lt;2.4$ (with weak signs of increasing
homogeneity with time) and explore the study of metal absorption as a function
of integrated SDSS-r band flux quasar flux (yielding consistent but less
significant results). While the metal absorption does show sensitivity to
large-scale 3D quasar proximity, the current incomplete quasar samples limit
detailed interpretation. This work does, however, demonstrate that UV
background inhomogeneities exist on scales of several 10s of comoving
megaparsecs associated with quasars and that they can be measured with
precision by examining metal absorption in the intergalactic medium.

than all definitions of the splashback radius in the literature by 20-100%. The
accretion shock radius defined using the steepest drop in the entropy pressure
profiles is approximately 2 times larger than the splashback radius defined by
the steepest slope in the dark matter density profile, and it is ~1.2 times
larger than the edge of the dark matter phase-space structure. We discuss

          <p>Following the path of minimalism in alternative theories of gravity, we
construct the "Minimal Theory of Bigravity" (MTBG), a theory of two interacting
spin-2 fields that propagates only four local degrees of freedom instead of the
usual seven ones and that allows for the same homogeneous and isotropic
cosmological solutions as in Hassan-Rosen bigravity (HRBG). Starting from a
precursor theory that propagates six local degrees of freedom, we carefully
choose additional constraints to eliminate two of them to construct the theory.
Investigating the cosmology of MTBG, we find that it accommodates two different
branches of homogeneous and isotropic background solutions, equivalent on-shell
to the two branches that are present in HRBG. Those branches in MTBG differ
however from the HRBG ones at the perturbative level, are both perfectly
healthy and do not exhibit strong coupling issues nor ghost instabilities. In
the so-called self-accelerating branch, characterized by the presence of an
effective cosmological constant, the scalar and vector sectors are the same as
in General Relativity (GR). In the so-called normal branch, the scalar sector
exhibits non-trivial phenomenology, while its vector sector remains the same as
in GR. In both branches, the tensor sector exhibits the usual HRBG features: an
effective mass term and oscillations of the gravitons. Therefore MTBG provides
a stable nonlinear completion of the cosmology in HRBG.

          <p>We consider a class of exponential models of $f(R)$ gravity, in the presence
of a canonical scalar field, for which at early times the effective Lagrangian
of the theory becomes that of a rescaled canonical scalar field with the
Einstein-Hilbert term becoming $\sim \alpha R$, with $\alpha$ a dimensionless
constant. This rescaled Einstein-Hilbert scalar field theory at early times
alters the inflationary phenomenology of well-known scalar field models of
inflation, but more importantly, in the context of this rescaled theory, the
Swampland criteria are easily satisfied, assuming that the scalar field is
slowly rolling. We consider two models of inflation to exemplify our study, a
fibre inflation model and a model that belongs to the general class of
supergravity $\alpha$-attractor models. The inflationary phenomenology of the
models is demonstrated to be viable, and for the same set of values of the free
parameters of each model which ensure their inflationary viability, all the
known Swampland criteria are satisfied too, and we need to note that we assumed
that the first Swampland criterion is marginally satisfied by the scalar field,
so $\phi\sim M_p$ during the inflationary era. Finally, we examine the
late-time phenomenology of the fibre inflation potential in the presence of the
full $f(R)$ gravity, and we demonstrate that the resulting model produces a
viable dark energy era, which resembles the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Mater model.
Thus in the modified gravity model we present, the Universe is described by a
rescaled Einstein-Hilbert gravity at early times, hence in some sense the
modified gravity effect is minimal primordially, and the scalar field controls
mainly the dynamics with a rescaled Ricci scalar gravity. However $f(R)$
gravity dominates at late-times, where it controls the dynamics,
synergistically with the scalar field.

          <p>The outskirts of accreting dark matter haloes exhibit a sudden drop in
density delimiting their multi-stream region. Due to the dynamics of accretion,
the location of this physically motivated edge strongly correlates with the
halo growth rate. Using hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of high-mass
clusters, we explore this definition in realistic simulations and find an
explicit connection between this feature in the dark matter and galaxy

          <p>We present a new theoretical picture of magnetically dominated, decaying
turbulence in the absence of a mean magnetic field. We demonstrate that such
turbulence is governed by the reconnection of magnetic structures, and not by
ideal dynamics, as has previously been assumed. We obtain predictions for the
magnetic-energy decay laws by proposing that turbulence decays on reconnection
timescales, while respecting the conservation of certain integral invariants
representing topological constraints satisfied by the reconnecting magnetic
field. As is well known, the magnetic helicity is such an invariant for
initially helical field configurations, but does not constrain non-helical
decay, where the volume-averaged magnetic-helicity density vanishes. For such a
decay, we propose a new integral invariant, analogous to the Loitsyansky and
Saffman invariants of hydrodynamic turbulence, that expresses the conservation
of the random (scaling as $\mathrm{volume}^{1/2}$) magnetic helicity contained
in any sufficiently large volume. Our treatment leads to novel predictions for
the magnetic-energy decay laws: in particular, while we expect the canonical
$t^{-2/3}$ power law for helical turbulence when reconnection is fast (i.e.,
plasmoid-dominated or stochastic), we find a shallower $t^{-4/7}$ decay in the
slow `Sweet-Parker' reconnection regime, in better agreement with existing
numerical simulations. For non-helical fields, for which there currently exists
no definitive theory, we predict power laws of $t^{-10/9}$ and $t^{-20/17}$ in
the fast- and slow-reconnection regimes, respectively. We formulate a general
principle of decay of turbulent systems subject to conservation of Saffman-like
invariants, and propose how it may be applied to MHD turbulence with a strong
mean magnetic field and to isotropic MHD turbulence with initial equipartition
between the magnetic and kinetic energies.

          <p>We propose a dark energy model based on the physics of critical phenomena
which is consistent with both the Planck's CMB and the Riess et al.'s local
Hubble measurements. In this model the dark energy density behaves like the
magnetization of the Ising model. This means the dark energy is an emergent
phenomenon and we named it critically emergent dark energy model, CEDE. In
CEDE, dark energy emerges at a transition redshift, $z_c$, corresponding to the
critical temperature in critical phenomena. Combining the Planck CMB data and
local measurement of the Hubble constant from Riess et al. (2019) we find
statistically significant support for this transition with respect to the case
of very early transition that represents effectively the cosmological constant.
This is understandable since CEDE model naturally prefers larger values of
Hubble constant consistent with local measurements. Since CEDE prefers a
non-trivial transition when we consider both high redshift Planck CMB data and
local Hubble constant measurements, we conclude that $H_0$ tension can be a
hint for the substructure of the dark energy as a well-studied properties of
critical phenomena.

the Henriques et al. (2015) public version of the Munich semi-analytical model
of galaxy formation (SAM) and the IllustrisTNG suite, primarily TNG300, with
observations from KiDS+GAMA and SDSS-DR7 using four different selection
functions for the lenses (stellar mass, stellar mass and group membership,
stellar mass and isolation criteria, stellar mass and colour). We find that
this version of the SAM does not agree well with the current data for stellar
mass-only lenses with $M_\ast &gt; 10^{11}\,M_\odot$. By decreasing the merger
time for satellite galaxies as well as reducing the radio-mode AGN accretion
efficiency in the SAM, we obtain better agreement, both for the lensing and the
clustering, at the high mass end. We show that the new model is consistent with
the signals for central galaxies presented in Velliscig et al. (2017). Turning
to the hydrodynamical simulation, TNG300 produces good lensing predictions,
both for stellar mass-only ($\chi^2 = 1.81$ compared to $\chi^2 = 7.79$ for the
SAM), and locally brightest galaxies samples ($\chi^2 = 3.80$ compared to
$\chi^2 = 5.01$). With added dust corrections to the colours it matches the
SDSS clustering signal well for red low mass galaxies. We find that both the

intermediate mass red galaxies with $10.2 &lt; \log_{10} M_\ast [ M_\odot ] &lt;

          <p>Extragalactic foregrounds in temperature maps of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) severely limit the ability of standard estimators to
reconstruct the weak lensing potential. These foregrounds are not fully
removable by multi-frequency cleaning or masking and can lead to large biases
if not properly accounted for. For foregrounds made of a number of unclustered
point sources, an estimator for the source amplitude can be derived and
deprojected, removing any bias to the lensing reconstruction. We show with
simulations that all of the extragalactic foregrounds in temperature can be
approximated by a collection of sources with identical profiles, and that a
simple bias hardening technique is effective at reducing any bias to lensing,
at a minimal noise cost. We compare the performance and bias to other methods
such as "shear-only" reconstruction, and discuss how to jointly deproject any
arbitrary number of foregrounds, each with an arbitrary profile. In particular,
for a Simons Observatory-like experiment foreground-hardened estimators allow
us to extend the maximum multipole used in the reconstruction, increasing the
overall statistical power by $\sim 50\%$ over the standard quadratic estimator,
both in auto and cross-correlation. We conclude that source hardening
outperforms the standard lensing quadratic estimator both in auto and
cross-correlation, and in terms of lensing signal-to-noise and foreground bias.

          <p>Lensing by galaxy clusters is a versatile probe of cosmology and
extragalactic astrophysics, but the accuracy of some of its predictions is
limited by the simplified models adopted to reduce the (otherwise untractable)
number of degrees of freedom. We aim at cluster lensing models where the
parameters of all cluster-member galaxies are free to vary around some common
scaling relations with non-zero scatter, and deviate significantly from them if
and only if the data require it. We have devised a Bayesian hierarchical
inference framework, which enables the determination of all lensing parameters
and of the scaling-relation hyperparameters, including intrinsic scatter, from
lensing constraints and (if given) stellar kinematic measurements. We achieve
this through BayesLens, a purpose-built wrapper around common parametric
lensing codes for the lensing likelihood that can sample the posterior on
parameters and hyperparameters, which we release with this paper. We have run
functional tests of our code against simple mock cluster lensing datasets with
realistic uncertainties. The parameters and hyperparameters are recovered
within their 68% credibility ranges, and the positions of all the "observed"
multiple images are accurately reproduced by the BayeLens best-fit model,
without overfitting. We have shown that an accurate description of cluster
member galaxies is attainable, despite the large number of degrees of freedom,
through fast and tractable inference. This extends beyond the state-of-the-art
of current cluster lensing models. The precise impact on studies of
cosmography, galaxy evolution and high-redshift galaxy populations can then be
quantified on real galaxy clusters. While other sources of systematics exist
and may be significant in real clusters, our results show that the contribution
of intrinsic scatter in cluster-member populations can now be controlled.

          <p>Rapidly rotating black holes are known to develop instabilities in the
presence of a sufficiently light boson, a process which becomes efficient when
the boson's Compton wavelength is roughly the size of the black hole. This
phenomenon, known as black hole superradiance, generates an exponentially
growing boson cloud at the expense of the rotational energy of the black hole.
For astrophysical black holes with $M \sim \mathcal{O}(10) \, M_\odot$, the
superradiant condition is achieved for bosons with $m_b \sim
\mathcal{O}(10^{-11} ) \, {\rm eV}$; intriguingly, photons traversing the
intergalactic medium (IGM) acquire an effective mass (due to their interactions
with the ambient plasma) which naturally resides in this range. The
implications of photon superradiance, i.e. the evolution of the superradiant
photon cloud and ambient plasma in the presence of scattering and particle
production processes, have yet to be thoroughly investigated. Here, we
enumerate and discuss a number of different processes capable of quenching the
growth of the photon cloud, including particle interactions with the ambient
electrons and back-reactions on the effective mass (arising e.g. from thermal
effects, pair-production, ionization of of the local background, and
modifications to the dispersion relation from strong electric fields). This

Gpc scales suggest a long-range modification to gravity. In this context, we
consider a cosmological MOND model supplemented with $11 \, \rm{eV}/c^{2}$
sterile neutrinos. We explain why this $\nu$HDM model has a nearly standard
expansion history, primordial abundances of light elements, and cosmic
microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. In MOND, structure growth is
self-regulated by external fields from surrounding structures. We constrain our
model parameters with the KBC void density profile, the local Hubble and
deceleration parameters derived jointly from supernovae at redshifts $0.023 -
0.15$, time delays in strong lensing systems, and the Local Group velocity
relative to the CMB. Our best-fitting model simultaneously explains these
observables at the $1.14\%$ confidence level (${2.53 \sigma}$ tension) if the

Thus, we show for the first time that the KBC void can naturally resolve the

long-wavelength (superhorizon) modes undergo amplification. For this purpose,
we introduce a set of functions (bilinear combinations of electromagnetic
fields with an arbitrary number of spatial curls) satisfying an infinite chain
of equations. Apart from the usual mode enhancement due to interaction with the
inflaton, these equations also take into account the fact that the number of
relevant modes constantly grows during inflation. Truncating this chain, we
show that even with a relatively small number of equations, it is possible to
describe the electric and magnetic energy densities with a few percent accuracy

frequent scatterings. We apply the same reasoning and techniques to the
evolution of neutrino flavors and energy distributions in the early universe in
the era of neutrino decoupling. It is likely that the resulting changes to the
classic numbers that have been used in cosmology will be significantly greater
than the ones that are found in recent updates of the theory in this region, in
which only cross-sections were used. On a closely related issue: predictions
for the production of sterile neutrinos, should they exist, will be changed
significantly.

          <p>The public GALPROP code gives a fully numerical solution for the spectrum of
cosmic rays propagating through a linear Galactic wind directed outwards from
the Galactic plane in the framework of a cylindrical diffusion model.
Alternatively, for the linear Galactic wind case, we present a semi-analytical
solution of the two-zone cylindrical model which describes the spectrum of
cosmic-ray antiprotons produced from the primary sources throughout the dark
matter halo. While the secondary antiprotons can be generated by, e.g., the
GALPROP WebRun, consistently using this semi-analytical solution for the
primary ones would be helpful to build a suited dark matter (DM) model, which
may be sophisticated, and then to perform a statistical analysis when
confronting with data. As an example, using the obtained formula, we study the
possible DM signal, through the channel $\text{DM~DM} \to {\bar b}b$, and its
constraint from the measurement of the AMS-02 antiproton-to-proton ratio. The
indication of the DM signal is discussed.

          <p>We propose an extension of the scalaron-Higgs model by a non-minimal coupling
of the Standard Model Higgs boson to the quadratic Ricci scalar resulting in a
Higgs-dependent scalaron mass. The model predicts a successful stage of
effective single-field Starobinsky inflation. It features a multi-field
amplification mechanism leading to a peak in the inflationary power spectrum at
small wavelengths which enhances the production of primordial black holes. The
extended scalaron-Higgs model unifies inflationary cosmology with elementary
particle physics and explains the origin of cold dark matter in terms of
primordial black holes without assuming any new particles.

        <strong>Affleck-Dine inflation in supergravity. (arXiv:2011.10397v2 [hep-ph] UPDATED)</strong>

          <p>Affleck-Dine inflation is a recently proposed model in which a single complex
scalar field, nonminimally coupled to gravity, drives inflation and
simultaneously generates the baryon asymmetry of universe via Affleck-Dine
mechanism. In this paper we investigate the supersymmetric implementation of
Affleck-Dine inflation in the use of two chiral superfields with appropriate
superpotential and K\"ahler potential. The scalar potential has a similar form
to the potential of original Affleck-Dine inflation, and it gives successful
inflation and baryogenesis. We also consider the isocurvature perturbation
evolving after crossing the horizon, and find that it is ignorable and hence
consistent with the observations.
