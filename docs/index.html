          <p>We examine the cosmological and astrophysical signatures of a "dark baryon,"
a neutral fermion that mixes with the neutron. As the mixing is through a
higher-dimensional operator at the quark level, production of the dark baryon
at high energies is enhanced so that its abundance in the early universe may be
significant. Treating its initial abundance as a free parameter, we derive new,
powerful limits on the properties of the dark baryon. Primordial
nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background provide strong constraints
due to the inter-conversion of neutrons to dark baryons through their induced
transition dipole, and due to late decays of the dark baryon. Additionally,
neutrons in a neutron star could decay slowly to dark baryons, providing a
novel source of heat that is constrained by measurements of pulsar
temperatures. Taking all the constraints into account, we identify parameter
space where the dark baryon can be a viable dark matter candidate and discuss
promising avenues for probing it.

          <p>Physical theories that depend on many parameters or are tested against data
from many different experiments pose unique challenges to parameter estimation.
Many models in particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology fall into one or
both of these categories. These issues are often sidestepped with very
simplistic and statistically unsound ad hoc methods, involving naive
intersection of parameter intervals estimated by multiple experiments, and
random or grid sampling of model parameters. Whilst these methods are easy to
apply, they exhibit pathologies even in low-dimensional parameter spaces, and
quickly become problematic to use and interpret in higher dimensions. In this
article we give clear guidance for going beyond these rudimentary procedures,
suggesting some simple methods for performing statistically sound inference,
and recommendations of readily-available software tools and standards that can
assist in doing so. Our aim is to provide physicists with recommendations for
reaching correct scientific conclusions, with only a modest increase in
analysis burden.

          <p>Third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors will be able to
observe binary-black-hole mergers (BBHs) up to redshift of $\sim 30$. This
gives unprecedented access to the formation and evolution of BBHs throughout
cosmic history. In this paper we consider three sub-populations of BBHs
originating from the different evolutionary channels: isolated formation in
galactic fields, dynamical formation in globular clusters and mergers of black
holes formed from Population III (Pop III) stars at very high redshift. Using
input from populations synthesis analyses, we created two months of simulated
data of a network of 3G detectors made of two Cosmic Explorers and an Einstein
Telescope, consisting of $\sim16000$ field and cluster BBHs as well as
$\sim400$ Pop III BBHs. First, we show how one can use non-parametric models to
infer the existence and characteristic of a primary and secondary peak in the
merger rate distribution. In particular, the location and the height of the
secondary peak around $z\approx 12$, arising from the merger of Pop III
remnants, can be constrained at $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ level. Then we perform a
modeled analysis, using phenomenological templates for the merger rates of the
three sub-population, and extract the branching ratios and the characteristic
parameters of the merger rate densities of the individual formation channels.
With this modeled method, the uncertainty on the measurement of the fraction of
Pop III BBHs can be improved to $\lesssim 10\%$, while the ratio between field
and cluster BBHs can be measured with an uncertainty of $\sim 50\%$.

          <p>In this paper, we study a triad of inhomogeneous scalar fields, known as
"solid", as a source of homogeneous but anisotropic dark energy. By using the
dynamical system approach, we find that anisotropic accelerated solutions can
be realized as attractor points for suitable choices of the parameters of the
model. We complement the dynamical analysis with a numerical solution whose
initial conditions are set in the deep radiation epoch. The model predicts a
non-negligible spatial shear within the observational bounds nowadays, even
when it is set to zero at early times. The anisotropic attractor and the ultra
slowly varying equation of state of dark energy very close to $- 1$ are key
features of this scenario. Following a similar approach, we also analyzed the
isotropic version of the model. We find that the solid can be characterized by
a nearly constant equation of state and thus being able to simulate the
behavior of a cosmological constant.

          <p>Large-scale sky surveys require companion large volume simulated mock
catalogs. To ensure precision cosmology studies are unbiased, the correlations
in these mocks between galaxy properties and their large-scale environments
must be realistic. Since galaxies are embedded in dark matter halos, an
important first step is to include such correlations -- sometimes called
assembly bias -- for dark matter halos. However, galaxy properties correlate
with smaller scale physics in halos which large simulations struggle to
resolve. We describe an algorithm which addresses and largely mitigates this
problem. Our algorithm exploits the fact that halo assembly bias is unchanged
as long as correlations between halo property $c$ and the intermediate-scale
tidal environment $\alpha$ are preserved. Therefore, knowledge of $\alpha$ is
sufficient to assign small-scale, otherwise unresolved properties to a halo in
a way which preserves its large-scale assembly bias accurately. We demonstrate
this explicitly for halo internal properties like formation history
(concentration $c_{\rm 200b}$), shape $c/a$, dynamics $c_{v}/a_{v}$, velocity
anisotropy $\beta$ and angular momentum (spin $\lambda$). Our algorithm
increases a simulation's reach in halo mass and number density by an order of
magnitude, with improvements in the bias signal as large as 45% for 30-particle
halos, thus significantly reducing the cost of mocks for future weak lensing
and redshift space distortion studies.

          <p>It is well-known that feedback processes play a fundamental role in the
regulation of star formation (SF) and, in particular, in the quenching of
early-type galaxies (ETGs) as have been inferred by numerical studies of
LambdaCDM universe models. At the same time, ETGs are subject to certain
fundamental scaling relations, but the connection between them and the physical
processes that effect ETG evolution remain unknown. This work aims at studying
the impact of the energetic feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the
formation and evolution of ETGs. Especially, we assess to what extent modelling
AGN feedback is necessary to reproduce observational constrains such as
morphology, kinematics and the evolution of the main scaling relations. The
Horizon-AGN and Horizon-noAGN cosmological hydrodynamical simulations were
performed with identical initial conditions and including the same physical
processes with the exception of the AGN feedback in the former. We select a
sample of ETGs from both simulations using the same criteria and subject them
to an exhaustive study regarding SF activity, kinematics and scaling relations.
We find that galaxies from Horizon-AGN follow observed fundamental scaling
relations (mass-plane, Fundamental Plane, mass-size relation) and reproduce,
qualitatively, kinematic features such as the bimodality in the spin parameter
distribution at z = 0. The specific star formation activity is within observed
ranges when AGN is turned on. Instead, galaxies formed in absence of AGN
feedback show differences with observations such as the departure from the
Fundamental Plane (FP) of a group of galaxies that have an excess of stellar
surface density, and a shallower mass-size relation populated by galaxies with
young stellar ages. Abridged

Galilean coordinates. The solutions to the 1+3-Newton-Cartan equations are
equivalent to the solutions of the classical Newton equations if space is

          <p>Self-interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) models have the potential to solve the
small-scale problems that arise in the Cold Dark Matter paradigm. Simulations
are a powerful tool for studying SIDM in the context of astrophysics, but it is
numerically challenging to study differential cross-sections that favour
small-angle scattering (as in light-mediator models). Here we present a novel
approach to model frequent scattering based on an effective drag force, which
we have implemented into the N-body code Gadget-3. In a range of test problems
we demonstrate that our implementation accurately models frequent scattering.
Our implementation can be used to study differences between SIDM models that
predict rare and frequent scattering. We simulate core formation in isolated
dark matter haloes, as well as major mergers of galaxy clusters. We find that
SIDM models with rare and frequent interactions cannot be mapped onto one
another. In particular, frequent interactions are able to produce larger
offsets between the distribution of galaxies and dark matter in equal-mass

          <p>By focusing on the simple $w\neq-1$ extension to $\Lambda$CDM, we assess
which epoch(s) possibly source the $H_0$-tension. We consider Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) data in three possible ways: $i)$ complete CMB data; $ii)$
excluding the $l&lt;30$ temperature and polarization likelihoods; $iii)$ imposing
early universe priors, that disentangle early and late time physics. Through a
joint analysis with low-redshift supernovae type-Ia and gravitationally lensed
time delay datasets, {and neglecting galaxy clustering Baryonic Acoustic
Oscillation (BAO) data}, we find that the inclusion of early universe CMB
priors is consistent with the local estimate of $H_0$ while excluding the
low-$l$+lowE likelihoods mildly relaxes the tension. This is in contrast to
joint analyses with the complete CMB data. Our simple implementation of
contrasting the effect of different CMB priors on the $H_0$ estimate shows that
the early universe information from the CMB data when decoupled from late-times
physics could be in agreement with a higher value of $H_0$. {We also find no
evidence for the early dark energy model using only the early universe physics
within the CMB data. Finally using the BAO data in different redshift ranges to
perform inverse distance ladder analysis, we find that the early universe
modifications, while being perfectly capable of alleviating the $H_0$-tension
when including the BAO galaxy clustering data, would be at odds with the
Ly-$\alpha$ BAO data due to the difference in $r_{\rm d}\, vs.\, H_0$
correlation between the two BAO datasets.} We therefore infer and speculate
that source for the $H_0$-tension between CMB and local estimates could
possibly originate in the modeling of late-time physics within the CMB
analysis. This in turn recasts the $H_0$-tension as an effect of late-time
physics in CMB, instead of the current early-time CMB vs. local late-time
physics perspective.

curiosity to a diverse extragalactic population with established host galaxies
and energy scales. While a wide range of models remain viable, the central
engines of FRBs are likely to involve energetic young magnetars, as confirmed
by the recent discovery of a Galactic analog to these extragalactic bursts.
Here we provide a brief introductory review of fast radio bursts, focusing on
the rapid recent progress in observations of these enigmatic events, our
understanding of their central engines, and their use as probes of the
intergalactic medium. We caution against a rush to judgement on the mechanisms
and classification of all FRBs: at this point, it remains plausible that there
could be one dominant central engine, as well as the possibility that radio
bursts are a generic feature produced by many different mechanisms. We also
emphasize the importance of improved modeling of our Galaxy and Galactic halo,
which otherwise impose systematic errors on every FRB line of sight. The future

          <p>We study systematic effects from half-wave plates (HWPs) for cosmic microwave
background (CMB) experiments using full-sky time-domain beam convolution
simulations. Using an optical model for a fiducial spaceborne two-lens
refractor telescope, we investigate how different HWP configurations optimized
for dichroic detectors centred at 95 and 150 GHz impact the reconstruction of
primordial B-mode polarization. We pay particular attention to possible biases
arising from the interaction of frequency dependent HWP non-idealities with
polarized Galactic dust emission and the interaction between the HWP and the
instrumental beam. To produce these simulations, we have extended the
capabilities of the publicly available beamconv code. To our knowledge, we
produce the first time-domain simulations that include both HWP non-idealities
and realistic full-sky beam convolution. Our analysis shows how certain
achromatic HWP configurations produce significant systematic polarization angle
offsets that vary for sky components with different frequency dependence. Our
analysis also demonstrates that once we account for interactions with HWPs,
realistic beam models with non-negligible cross-polarization and sidelobes will
cause significant B-mode residuals that will have to be extensively modelled in
some cases.

          <p>Axions/axion-like particles (ALPs) are a well motivated extension of the
Standard Model and are generic within String Theory. The X-ray transparency of
the intracluster medium (ICM) in galaxy clusters is a powerful probe of light
ALPs (with mass $&lt;10^{-11}\,{\rm eV}$); as X-ray photons from an embedded or
background source propagate through the magnetized ICM, they may undergo
energy-dependent quantum mechanical conversion into ALPs (and vice versa),
imprinting distortions on the X-ray spectrum. We present Chandra data for the
active galactic nucleus NGC1275 at the center of the Perseus cluster. Employing
a 490ks High-Energy Transmission Gratings (HETG) exposure, we obtain a
high-quality 1-9keV spectrum free from photon pileup and ICM contamination.
Apart from iron-band features, the spectrum is described by a power-law
continuum, with any spectral distortions at the $&lt;3\%$ level. We compute photon
survival probabilities as a function of ALP mass $m_a$ and ALP-photon coupling
constant $g_{a\gamma}$ for an ensemble of ICM magnetic field models, and then
use the NGC1275 spectrum to constraint the $(m_a, g_{a\gamma})$-plane.
Marginalizing over magnetic field realizations, the 99.7% credible region
limits the ALP-photon coupling to $g_{a\gamma}&lt;6-8\times 10^{-13}\, {\rm
GeV}^{-1}$ (depending upon magnetic field model) for masses $m_a&lt;1\times
10^{-12}\,{\rm eV}$. These are the most stringent limit to date on
$g_{a\gamma}$ for these light ALPs, and have already reached the sensitivity
limits of next-generation helioscopes and light-shining-through-wall
experiments. We highlight the potential of these studies with the
next-generation X-ray observatories Athena and Lynx, but note the critical
importance of advances in relative calibration of these future X-ray

          <p>It is commonly argued that an undesirable feature of a theoretical or
phenomenological model is that salient observables are sensitive to values of
parameters in the model. But in what sense is it undesirable to have such
'fine-tuning' of observables (and hence of the underlying model)? In this
paper, we argue that the fine-tuning can be interpreted as a shortcoming of the
explanatory capacity of the model: in particular it signals a lack of
explanatory depth. In support of this argument, we develop a schema -- for (a
certain class of) models that arise broadly in physical settings -- that
quantitatively relates fine-tuning of observables to a lack of depth of
explanations based on these models. We apply our schema in two different
settings in which, within each setting, we compare the depth of two competing
explanations. The first setting involves explanations for the Euclidean nature
of spatial slices of the universe today: in particular, we compare an
explanation provided by the big-bang model of the early 1970s (where no
inflationary period is included) with an explanation provided by a general
model of cosmic inflation. The second setting has a more phenomenological
character, where the goal is to infer from a limited sequence of data points,
using maximum entropy techniques, the underlying probability distribution from
which these data are drawn. In both of these settings we find that our analysis
favors the model that intuitively provides the deeper explanation of the
observable(s) of interest. We thus provide an account that relates two
'theoretical virtues' of models used broadly in physical settings -- namely, a
lack of fine-tuning and explanatory depth -- and argue that finely tuned models
sacrifice explanatory depth.

          <p>Considering the upcoming OWFA, we use simulations of the foregrounds and the

$(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel})$ modes where the expected 21-cm power spectrum
$P(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel})$ is substantially larger than the predicted
foreground contribution. Only these uncontaminated $k$-modes are used for
measuring $P(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel})$ in the "Foreground Avoidance" technique.
Though the foregrounds are largely localised within a wedge. we find that the
small leakage beyond the wedge surpasses the 21-cm signal across a significant
part of the $(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel})$ plane. The extent of foreground leakage
is extremely sensitive to the frequency window function used to estimate
$P(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel})$. It is possible to reduce the leakage by making
the window function narrower, however this comes at the expense of losing a
larger fraction of the 21-cm signal. It is necessary to balance these competing
effects to identify an optimal window function. Considering a broad class of
cosine window functions, we identify a six term window function as optimal for
21-cm power spectrum estimation with OWFA. Considering only the $k$-modes where
the expected 21-cm power spectrum exceeds the predicted foregrounds by a factor
of $100$ or larger, a $5\,\sigma$ detection of the binned power spectrum is
possible in the $k$ ranges $0.18 \leq k \leq 0.3 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $0.18

          <p>We investigate the idea that current cosmic acceleration could be the
consequence of gravitational leakage into extra dimensions on cosmological
scales rather than the result of a non-zero cosmological constant, and consider
the ability of future gravitational-wave siren observations to probe this
phenomenon and constrain the parameters of phenomenological models of this
gravitational leakage. In theories that include additional non-compact
spacetime dimensions, the gravitational leakage intro extra dimensions leads to
a reduction in the amplitude of observed gravitational waves and thereby a
systematic discrepancy between the distance inferred to such sources from GW
and EM observations. We investigate the capability of a gravitational space
interferometer such as LISA to probe this modified gravity on large scales. We
find that the extent to which LISA will be able to place limits on the number
of spacetime dimensions and other cosmological parameters characterising
modified gravity will strongly depend on the actual number and redshift
distribution of sources, together with the uncertainty on the GW measurements.
A relatively small number of sources ($\sim 1$) and high measurement
uncertainties would strongly restrict the ability of LISA to place meaningful
constraints on the parameters in cosmological scenarios where gravity is only
five-dimensional and modified at scales larger than about $\sim 4$ times the
Hubble radius. Conversely, if the number of sources observed amounts to a
four-year average of $\sim 27$, then in the most favourable cosmological
scenarios LISA has the potential to place meaningful constraints on the
cosmological parameters with a precision of $\sim 1\%$ on the number of
dimensions and $\sim 7.5\%$ on the scale beyond which gravity is modified,
thereby probing the late expansion of the universe up to a redshift of $\sim
8$.

gravitational lensing from the fourth data release of the ESO Kilo-Degree
Survey (KiDS-1000) and galaxy clustering from the partially overlapping BOSS
and 2dFLenS surveys. Cross-correlations between galaxy positions and
ellipticities have been incorporated into the analysis, necessitating a hybrid
model of non-linear scales that blends perturbative and non-perturbative
approaches, and an assessment of contributions by astrophysical effects. All
weak lensing signals are measured consistently via Fourier-space statistics
that are insensitive to the survey mask and display low levels of mode mixing.
The calibration of photometric redshift distributions and multiplicative
gravitational shear bias has been updated, and a more complete tally of
residual calibration uncertainties is propagated into the likelihood. A
dedicated suite of more than 20000 mocks is used to assess the performance of
covariance models and to quantify the impact of survey geometry and spatial
variations of survey depth on signals and their errors. The sampling
distributions for the likelihood and the $\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit statistic
have been validated, with proposed changes to the number of degrees of freedom.
Standard weak lensing point estimates on $S_8=\sigma_8\,(\Omega_{\rm
m}/0.3)^{1/2}$ derived from its marginal posterior are easily misinterpreted to
be biased low, and an alternative estimator and associated credible interval
have been proposed. Known systematic effects pertaining to weak lensing
modelling and inference are shown to bias $S_8$ by no more than 0.1 standard
deviations, with the caveat that no conclusive validation data exist for models
of intrinsic galaxy alignments. Compared to the previous KiDS analyses, $S_8$
constraints are expected to improve by 20% for weak lensing alone and by 29%

          <p>The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) is an extended gamma-ray source in the
central region of the Galaxy found in Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT)
data. One of the leading explanations for the GCE is an unresolved population
of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the Galactic bulge. Due to differing star
formation histories it is expected that the MSPs in the Galactic bulge are
older and therefore dimmer than those in the Galactic disk. Additionally,
correlations between the spectral parameters of the MSPs and the spin-down rate
of the corresponding neutron stars have been observed. This implies that the
bulge MSPs may be spectrally different from the disk MSPs. We perform detailed
modelling of the MSPs from formation until observation. Although we confirm the
correlations, we do not find they are sufficiently large to significantly
differentiate the spectra of the bulge MSPs and disk MSPs when the
uncertainties are accounted for. Our results demonstrate that the population of
MSPs that can explain the gamma-ray signal from the resolved MSPs in the
Galactic disk and the unresolved MSPs in the boxy bulge and nuclear bulge can
consistently be described as arising from a common evolutionary trajectory for
some subset of astrophysical sources common to all these different
environments. We do not require that there is anything unusual about inner
Galaxy MSPs to explain the GCE. Additionally, we use a more accurate geometry
for the distribution of bulge MSPs and incorporate dispersion measure estimates
of the MSPs' distances. We find that the elongated boxy bulge morphology means
that some the bulge MSPs are closer to us and so easier to resolve. We identify
three resolved MSPs that have significant probabilities of belonging to the
bulge population.

diverse origins. Their expected mass and spin distributions depend on the
specifics of the formation mechanisms. When a physically motivated prior
distribution is used in a Bayesian inference, the parameters estimated from the
gravitational-wave data can change significantly, potentially affecting the
physical interpretation of certain gravitational-wave events and their
implications on theoretical models. As a case study we analyze primordial black
holes, which might be formed in the early universe and could comprise at least
a fraction of the dark matter. If accretion is not efficient during their
cosmic history, primordial black holes are expected to be almost non-spinning.
If accretion is efficient, massive binaries tend to be symmetrical and highly
spinning. We show that incorporating these priors can significantly change the
inferred mass ratio and effective spin of some binary black hole events,
especially those identified as high-mass, asymmetrical, or spinning by a
standard analysis using agnostic priors. For several events, the Bayes factors
are only mildly affected by the new priors, implying that it is hard to
distinguish whether merger events detected so far are of primordial or
astrophysical origin. In particular, if binaries identified by LIGO/Virgo as
strongly asymmetrical (including GW190412) are of primordial origin, their mass
ratio inferred from the data can be closer to unity. For GW190412, the latter
property is strongly affected by the inclusion of higher harmonics in the

Group in a wider context. The number of confirmed satellites per system ranges
from zero to nine, and correlates with host galaxy and brightest satellite
luminosities. We find that the number and the luminosities of MW satellites are
consistent with being drawn from the same underlying distribution as SAGA
systems. The majority of confirmed SAGA satellites are star forming, and the
quenched fraction increases as satellite stellar mass and projected radius from
the host galaxy decrease. Overall, the satellite quenched fraction among SAGA
systems is lower than that in the Local Group. We compare the luminosity
functions and radial distributions of SAGA satellites with theoretical
predictions based on cold dark matter simulations and an empirical galaxy-halo
connection model and find that the results are broadly in agreement.

          <p>We examine how the post-processed content of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) in
galaxies from the TNG100 cosmological, hydrodynamic simulation changes with
environment at $z\!=\!0$, assessing central/satellite status and host halo
mass. We make close comparisons with the carbon monoxide (CO) emission survey
xCOLD GASS where possible, having mock-observed TNG100 galaxies to match the
survey's specifications. For a representative sample of host haloes across
$10^{11}\!\lesssim\!M_{\rm 200c}/{\rm M}_{\odot}\!&lt;\!10^{14.6}$, TNG100
predicts that satellites with $m_*\!\geq\!10^9\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ should have a
median deficit in their H$_2$ fractions of $\sim$0.6 dex relative to centrals
of the same stellar mass. Once observational and group-finding uncertainties
are accounted for, the signature of this deficit decreases to $\sim$0.2 dex.
Remarkably, we calculate a deficit in xCOLD GASS satellites' H$_2$ content
relative to centrals of 0.2--0.3 dex, in line with our prediction. We further
show that TNG100 and SDSS data exhibit continuous declines in the average star
formation rates of galaxies at fixed stellar mass in denser environments, in
quantitative agreement with each other. By tracking satellites from their
moment of infall in TNG100, we directly show that atomic hydrogen (HI) is
depleted at fractionally higher rates than H$_2$ on average. Supporting this
picture, we find that the H$_2$/HI mass ratios of satellites are elevated
relative to centrals in xCOLD GASS. We provide additional predictions for the
effect of environment on H$_2$ -- both absolute and relative to HI -- that can
be tested with spectral stacking in future CO surveys.

          <p>In this paper, we investigate the possibility of testing the weakly
interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM) models by applying the
simplest phenomenological model which introduces an interaction term between
dark energy (DE) and WIMP DM, i.e., $Q = 3\gamma_{DM} H\rho_{DM}$. In general,
the coupling strength $\gamma_{DE}$ is close to $0$ due to the interaction
between DE and WIMP DM is very weak, thus the effect of $\gamma_ {DE}$ on the
evolution of $Y$ associated with DM energy density can be safely ignored.
Meanwhile, our numerical calculation also indicates that $x_f\approx20$ is
associated with DM freeze-out temperature, which is the same as the vanishing
interaction scenario. As for DM relic density, it will be magnified by
$\frac{2-3\gamma_{DM}}{2}[{2\pi g_* m_{DM}^3}/{(45 s_0 x_f^3})]^{\gamma_{DM}}$
times, which provides a new way for us to test WIMP DM models. As an example,
we analyze the case in which WIMP DM is a scalar DM. (SGL+SNe+Hz) and
(GRBs+SNe+BAO+CMB) cosmological observations will give out
$\gamma_{DM}=0.134^{+0.17}_{-0.069}$ and $\gamma_{DM}=-0.0047\pm0.0046$,
respectively. After further considering the constraints from both the DM direct
detection experiment and DM relic density, we observe that the allowed
parameter space of the scalar DM model will be completely excluded for the
former cosmological observations, while it will increase for the latter ones.
Those two cosmological observations lead to a paradoxical conclusion. Thus we
wish the more accuracy of the cosmological observation can be obtained in the
near future to test the WIMP DM models.

          <p>Galaxy clusters grow by merging with other clusters, giving rise to Mpc-wide
shock waves that travel at 1000-2500 km/s through the intra-cluster medium. To
study the effects of merger shocks on the properties of cluster galaxies, we
present the first spatially resolved spectroscopic view of 5 H$\alpha$ emitting
galaxies located in the wake of shock fronts in the low redshift (z~0.2),
massive (~2$\times10^{15}$ M$_\odot$), post-core passage merging cluster, CIZA
J2242.8+5301 (nicknamed the `Sausage'). Our Gemini/GMOS-N integral field unit
(IFU) observations, designed to capture H$\alpha$ and [NII] emission, reveal
the nebular gas distribution, kinematics and metallicities in the galaxies over
&gt;16 kpc scales. While the galaxies show evidence for rotational support, the
flux and velocity maps have complex features like tails and gas outflows
aligned with the merger axis of the cluster. With gradients incompatible with
inside-out disk growth, the metallicity maps are consistent with sustained star
formation (SF) throughout and outside of the galactic disks. In combination
with previous results, these pilot observations provide further evidence of a
likely connection between cluster mergers and SF triggering in cluster
galaxies, a potentially fundamental discovery revealing the interaction of
galaxies with their environment.

          <p>BICEP3 is a 520 mm aperture on-axis refracting telescope at the South Pole,
which observes the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at 95
GHz to search for the B-mode signal from inflationary gravitational waves. In
addition to this main target, we have developed a low-elevation observation
strategy to extend coverage of the Southern sky at the South Pole, where BICEP3
can quickly achieve degree-scale E-mode measurements over a large area. An
interesting E-mode measurement is probing a potential polarization anomaly
around the CMB Cold Spot. During the austral summer seasons of 2018-19 and
2019-20, BICEP3 observed the sky with a flat mirror to redirect the beams to
various low elevation ranges. The preliminary data analysis shows degree-scale
E-modes measured with high signal-to-noise ratio.
