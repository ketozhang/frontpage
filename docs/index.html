          <p>Oscillons are localized states of scalar fields sustained by self
interactions. They decay by emitting classical radiation, but their lifetimes
are surprisingly large. We revisit the reasons behind their longevity, aiming
at how the shape of the scalar potential $V(\phi)$ determines the lifetime. The
corpuscular picture, where the oscillon is identified with a bound state of a
large number of field quanta, allows to understand lifetimes of order of $10^3$
cycles in generic potentials. At the non-perturbative level, two properties of
the scalar potential can substantially boost the lifetime: the flattening of
$V(\phi)$ and the positivity of $V''(\phi)$. These properties are realized in
the axion monodromy family of potentials. Moreover, this class of models
connects continuously with an exceptional potential that admits eternal
oscillon solutions. We check these results with a new fast-forward numerical
method that allows to evolve in time to stages that cannot be otherwise
simulated on a computer. The method exploits the attractor properties of the
oscillons and fully accounts for nonlinearities. We find lifetimes up to
$10^{14}$ cycles, but larger values are possible. Our work shows that oscillons
formed in the early Universe can be stable on cosmological time scales and thus
contribute to the abundance of (ultra)light scalar dark matter.

          <p>Accounting for the triaxial shapes of galaxy clusters is expected to become
important in the context of the upcoming cosmological surveys. While the
distribution of matter in galaxy clusters cannot be described with simple
geometrical models without loss of information, their gravitational potential
can be very well approximated by a sphere or a spheroid. We study the shape of
the isodensity and isopotential contours in a relaxed and dynamically active
simulated clusters, with both a principal component analysis (PCA) and an
elliptical fitting procedure. We then analyze how the choice of the
substructure removal algorithm and the representation of the data (cumulative
vs thin shell) affect the results. For the matter distribution, we find that
the orientation and axis ratio of the isodensity contours are highly degenerate
with the presence of substructures and unstable against the representation of
the data. In addition, we observe that as the derived cluster shape depends on
the method used for removing the substructures, thermodynamic properties
extracted from, for instance, the X-ray emissivity profile, suffer from this
additional, and often underestimated, bias. In contrast, as the potential is
smoother and more spherical than the matter density, the PCA results on the
isopotential contours are robust against the choice of representations of the
data, and converge toward simple geometrical models for both the relaxed and
the dynamically active clusters. The fact that clusters potentials can be
represented by simple geometrical models and reconstructed with a low level of
systematics for both dynamically active and relaxed clusters (see Tchernin et
al. 2020), suggests that by characterizing galaxy clusters by their potential
rather than by their mass, dynamically active and relaxed clusters could be
combined in cosmological studies, improving statistics and lowering
scatter.[abr.]

fraction of all massive galaxies. Nevertheless this topic needs more
investigation as fraction of LLAGN in all AGN are much more higher than
fraction of researches dedicated to LLAGN among all AGN studies. The goal of
our work is checking out X-ray properties of LLAGN. For this purpose we created
a sample of LLAGN by selecting most prominent LLAGN from literature and
analyzed their X-ray spectral properties. As a result, we obtained 12 LLAGN and
for 8 of them XMM X-ray observations are available. The spectra from one XMM

Hubble scale masses on the inflationary bispectrum in the squeezed limit,
particular paying attention to the question how to disentangle mass spectra of
such fields. We consider two isocurvatons with almost degenerate masses and the
coupling of an inflaton to both isocurvatons as an example. We find that the
characteristic feature associated with nearly degenerate masses appears in the
oscillating part of the bispectrum, which is dominated by a waveform with a
specific wavelength roughly given by an inverse of the mass difference. Such a
waveform with a relatively longer wavelength can be easily identified and
useful for disentangling almost degenerate mass spectra. This situation is in
sharp contrast with the case of collider experiments on earth, where the very
precise energy resolution corresponding to the mass difference is required to
disentangle almost degenerate mass spectra. Therefore, if future observations
could detect this kind of a characteristic feature in bispectrum of the
primordial curvature perturbations, it can prove the existence of degenerate
multiple particles around the Hubble scale and resolve their mass degeneracies.

strongly present day phantom dark energy behavior implied by this class of

such effect may be observable in the dynamics of the nearest and largest bound

a phantom scalar field frozen by Hubble friction mimicking the cosmological

decreases below the field dynamical scale.

era of gravitational wave interferometer astronomy. Besides these strong,
transient, calamitous events, much weaker signals can be detected if the
oscillations are nearly monochromatic and "continuous", that is, coherent over
a long time. In this work we show that ultra-light dark matter of spin two,
owing to its universal coupling $\alpha$ to Standard Model fields, generates a
signal that is akin to but distinct from a continuous gravitational wave. We
show that this signal could be detected with current and planned gravitational
wave interferometers. In the event of a null detection, current facilities
could constrain the coupling to be below $\alpha\sim10^{-7}$ for frequencies of
tens of Hz, corresponding to dark matter masses around the $10^{-13}$ eV mark.
Future facilities could further lower these upper limits and extend them to
smaller masses down to $10^{-18}$ eV. These limits would be the most stringent
bounds on the spin-2 Yukawa fifth force strength, parametrised by $\alpha$, in
the frequency ranges accessible by gravitational wave interferometers. The
implementation of this type of searches for gravitational wave interferometers
would therefore further our grasp of both dark matter and gravity.

          <p>Gravitational waves (GWs) induced by scalar curvature fluctuations are an
important source of the cosmological GW background and a crucial counterpart of
the primordial black hole scenario. However, doubts have been cast on the
theoretically predicted induced GW spectrum due to its seeming gauge
dependence. In this paper, we shed light on the gauge dependence issue of the
induced GW spectrum in general cosmological backgrounds. First, inspired by the
Hamiltonian formalism we provide very simple formulas for the tensor modes at
second order in cosmological perturbation theory. We also emphasize the
difference between observable and gauge invariant variables. Second, we argue
that the Newton (or shear-free) gauge is suitable for both the calculation of
induced GWs and the physical interpretation. We then show that, most notably,
the induced GW spectrum is invariant under a set of reasonable gauge
transformations, i.e. physically well behaved on small scales, once the source
term has become inactive. This includes the commonly used flat, constant Hubble
and synchronous gauges but excludes the comoving slicing gauge. We also show
that a particular solution of the GW equation in a dust dominated universe
while the source term is active can be gauged away by a small change of gauge.

inflation, it is in tension with recent Planck cosmic microwave background

considering a very weak nonminimal coupling of inflaton field to gravity, in
both contexts of metric and Palatini formulations of gravity. We start with
generic forms of coupling function, then take its simplest form to do
phenomenological analysis. Our results show that such an extension can render
natural inflation's predictions in a good agreement with the Planck data. As
long as the inflaton's coupling to the Ricci scalar is $|\xi|\sim 10^{-3}$ and
the symmetry breaking scale $f\gtrsim 2.0 M_{\mathrm{pl}}$, predictions of the
model can stay inside $68\%$ CL allowed regions until the $f$ growing up to
$7.7 M_{\mathrm{pl}}$, then only inside $95\%$ CL region when $f$ exceeds this

the simple form of the coupling function we use and the small magnitude of the
coupling $\xi$. Successful reheating can also be realized in this model.

          <p>We present new LOFAR observations of the massive merging galaxy cluster MACS
J0717.5+3745. The cluster hosts the most powerful radio halo known to date.
These new observations, in combination with published uGMRT (300$-$850 MHz) and
VLA (1$-$6.5 GHz) data, reveal that the halo is more extended than previously
thought, with a largest linear size of $\sim2.2 \rm Mpc$. The halo shows a
steep spectrum ($\alpha_{144\,\text{MHz}}^{1.5\,\text{GHz}}\sim-1.4$) and a
steepening ($\alpha_{1.5 \text{GHz}}^{5.5 \text{GHz}}\sim-1.9$) above 1.5 GHz.
We find a strong scattering in spectral index maps on scales of 50$-$100 kpc.
We suggest that such a strong scattering may be a consequence of the regime
where inverse Compton dominate the energy losses of electrons. The spectral
index becomes steeper and shows an increased curvature in the outermost regions
of the halo. We combined the radio data with \textit{Chandra} observations to
investigate the connection between the thermal and non-thermal components of
the intracluster medium (ICM). Despite a significant substructure in the halo
emission, the radio brightness correlates strongly with the X-ray brightness at
all observed frequencies. The radio-versus-X-ray brightness correlation slope
steepens at a higher radio frequency (from $b_{144 \text{MHz}}=0.67\pm0.05$ to
$b_{3.0 \text{GHz}}=0.98\pm0.09$) and the spectral index shows a significant
anti correlation with the X-ray brightness. Both pieces of evidence further
support a spectral steepening in the external regions. The compelling evidence
for a steep spectral index, the existence of a spectral break above 1.5 GHz,
and the dependence of radio and X-ray surface brightness correlation on
frequency are interpreted in the context of turbulent reacceleration models.
Under this scenario, our results allowed us to constrain that the turbulent
kinetic pressure of the ICM is up to 10%.

distribution. In this work, we study the prediction of the \"u$\Lambda$CDM as a
probable solution for $H_0$ tension for CMB lensing. We show that this model
relaxes the CMB lensing tension and $H_0$ tension simultaneously. Accordingly,

          <p>Measures of discordance between datasets have become an essential part of
cosmological analyses. It is important to accurately evaluate the significance
of such discordances when present. We propose here a Bayesian interpretation of
inconsistency measures that can extract information about physical
inconsistencies in the presence of data scatter. The new framework is based on
the conditional probability distribution of the level of physical inconsistency
given the obtained value of the measure. We use the index of inconsistency as a
case study to illustrate the new interpretation framework, but this can be
generalized to other metrics. Importantly, there are two aspects in the
quantification of inconsistency that behave differently as the number of model
parameters increases. The first is the probability for the level of physical
inconsistency to reach a threshold which drops with the increase of the number
of parameters under consideration. Then the second is the actual level of
physical inconsistency which remains rather insensitive to such an increase in
parameters. This often-overlooked ambiguity leads to an underestimation of the
physical inconsistency by the commonly adopted significance level when used,
but is resolved by the Bayesian interpretation because the conditional
probability distribution includes all the statistical information of the level
of physical inconsistency. Finally, we apply the Bayesian interpretation to
examine the (in)consistency between Planck versus the Cepheid-based local
measurement, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Atacama Cosmology Telescope
(ACT) and WMAP. We confirm and revisit the degrees of previous physical
inconsistencies and show the stability of the new interpretation to the number
of cosmological parameters compared to the commonly used n-$\sigma$
interpretation when applied to cosmological tensions in multi-parameter spaces.

wave (GW) event GW190814, which resulted from the coalescence of a 23 $M_\odot$
black hole with a 2.6 $M_\odot$ compact object, as a standard siren. No
compelling electromagnetic counterpart has been identified for this event, thus
our analysis accounts for thousands of potential host galaxies within a
statistical framework. The redshift information is obtained from the
photometric redshift (photo-$z$) catalog from the Dark Energy Survey. The
luminosity distance is provided by the LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave sky map.
Since this GW event has the second-smallest localization volume after GW170817,
GW190814 is likely to provide the best constraint on cosmology from a single
standard siren without identifying an electromagnetic counterpart. Our analysis
uses photo-$z$ probability distribution functions and corrects for photo-$z$
biases. We also reanalyze the binary-black hole GW170814 within this updated
framework. We explore how our findings impact the $H_0$ constraints from
GW170817, the only GW merger associated with a unique host galaxy. From a
combination of GW190814, GW170814 and GW170817, our analysis yields $H_0 =

HDI) for a prior in $H_0$ uniform between $[20,140]~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$.
The addition of GW190814 and GW170814 to GW170817 improves the 68\% HDI from
GW170817 alone by $\sim 18\%$, showing how well-localized mergers without

          <p>Far-infrared (FIR) dust polarimetry enables the study of interstellar
magnetic fields via tracing of the polarized emission from dust grains that are
partially aligned with the direction of the field. The advent of high quality
polarimetric data has permitted the use of statistical methods to extract both
the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field. In this work, the
Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi technique is used to make maps of the plane-of-sky
(POS) component of the magnetic field in the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC-1) by
combining polarization maps at 53, 89, 154 and 214 \micron\ from HAWC+/SOFIA
with maps of density and velocity dispersion. In addition, maps of the local
dispersion of polarization angles are used in conjuction with Zeeman
measurements to estimate a map of the strength of the line-of-sight (LOS)
component of the field. Combining these maps, information about the
three-dimensional magnetic field configuration (integrated along the
line-of-sight) is inferred over the OMC-1 region. POS magnetic field strengths
of up to 2 mG are observed near the BN/KL object, while the OMC-1 bar shows
strengths of up to a few hundred $\mu$G. These estimates of the magnetic field
components are used to produce maps of the mass-to-magnetic flux ratio
($M/\Phi$) -- a metric for probing the conditions for star formation in
molecular clouds -- and determine regions of sub- and super-criticality in
OMC-1. Such maps can provide invaluable input and comparison to MHD simulations
of star formation processes in filamentary structures of molecular clouds.

galaxy power spectrum multipoles from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (BOSS). We obtain parameter estimates that agree well with those based
on the sample covariance from two thousand galaxy mock catalogs, thus
validating the analytic approach and providing substantial reduction in
computational cost. We also highlight a number of additional advantages of
analytic covariances. First, the analysis does not suffer from sampling noise,
which biases the constraints and typically requires inflating parameter error
bars. Second, it allows us to study convergence of the cosmological constraints
when recomputing the analytic covariances to match the best-fit power spectrum,
which can be done at a negligible computational cost, unlike when using mock
catalogs. These effects reduce the systematic error budget of cosmological
constraints, which suggests that the analytic approach may be an important tool
for upcoming high-precision galaxy redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid.
Finally, we study the impact of various ingredients in the power spectrum
covariance matrix and show that the non-Gaussian part, which includes the
regular trispectrum and super-sample covariance, has a marginal effect
($\lesssim 10 \%$) on the cosmological parameter error bars. We also suggest
improvements to analytic covariances that are commonly used in Fisher

Given this starting point, we then build a cosmological perturbation theory on
top of it, study the gauge transformation properties related to this new set of
perturbations and show the connection with standard cosmological perturbation
theory. In particular, we obtain which gauge in standard perturbation theory
corresponds to the GLC gauge, and put in evidence how this is a useful
alternative to the standard Synchronous Gauge. Moreover, we exploit several
viable definitions for gauge invariant combinations. Among others, we build the
gauge invariant variables such that their values equal the ones of linearized
GLC gauge perturbations. This choice is motivated by two crucial properties of
the GLC gauge: i) it admits simple expressions for light-like observables, e.g.
redshift and angular distance, at fully non-linear level and ii) the GLC proper
time coincides with the one of a free-falling observer. Thanks to the first
property, exact expressions can then be easily expanded at linear order to
obtain linear gauge invariant expression for the chosen observable. Moreover,
the second feature naturally provides gauge invariant expressions for physical
observables in terms of the time as measured by such free-falling observer.
Finally, we explicitly show all these aspects for the case of the linearized

in $\Lambda$CDM, based on a high-resolution simulation performed using the
adaptive-mesh refinement general-relativistic $N$-body code GRAMSES. We study
the generation of vorticity in the dark matter velocity field at low redshift,
providing fits to the shape and evolution of its power spectrum over a range of
scales. By analysing the gravitomagnetic vector potential, which is absent in
Newtonian simulations, in dark matter haloes with masses ranging from
$\sim10^{12.5}~h^{-1}{M}_{\odot}$ to $\sim10^{15}~h^{-1}{M}_{\odot}$, we find
that its magnitude correlates with the halo mass, peaking in the inner regions.
Nevertheless, on average, its ratio against the scalar gravitational potential
remains fairly constant, below percent level, decreasing roughly linearly with
redshift and showing a weak dependence on halo mass. Furthermore, we show that
the gravitomagnetic acceleration in haloes peaks towards the core and reaches
almost $10^{-10}$ $h$ cm/s$^2$ in the most massive halo of the simulation.
However, regardless of the halo mass, the ratio between the magnitudes of the
gravitomagnetic force and the standard gravitational force is typically at
around the $10^{-5}$ level inside the haloes, again without significant radius

the impact on observations remains to be understood in the future.

properties on stronger theoretical footing. We find that GPR-FS can distort the
window functions at these low k modes, which, without proper decorrelation,
make it difficult to probe the EoR power spectrum. Incidentally, we also show
that GPR-FS is in fact closely related to the widely studied optimal quadratic
estimator. As a case study, we look at recent power spectrum upper limits from
the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) that utilized GPR-FS. We pay close attention to
their normalization scheme, showing that it is particularly sensitive to signal
loss when the EoR covariance is misestimated. This implies possible
ramifications for recent astrophysical interpretations of the LOFAR limits,
because many of the EoR models ruled out do not fall within the bounds of the
covariance models explored by LOFAR. Being more robust to this bias (although
not entirely free of it), we conclude that the quadratic estimator is a more
natural framework for implementing GPR-FS and computing the 21 cm power
spectrum.

          <p>How and when did galaxies form and assemble their stars and stellar mass? The
answer to these questions, so crucial to astrophysics and cosmology, requires
the full reconstruction of the so called cosmic star formation rate density
(SFRD), i.e. the evolution of the average star formation rate per unit volume
of the universe. While the SFRD has been reliably traced back to 10-11 billion
years ago, its evolution is still poorly constrained at earlier cosmic epochs,
and its estimate is mainly based on galaxies luminous in the ultraviolet and
with low obscuration by dust. This limited knowledge is largely due to the lack
of an unbiased census of all types of star-forming galaxies in the early
universe. We present a new approach to find dust-obscured star-forming galaxies
based on their emission at radio wavelengths coupled with the lack of optical
counterparts. Here, we present a sample of 197 galaxies selected with this
method. These systems were missed by previous surveys at optical and
near-infrared wavelengths, and 22 of them are at very high redshift (i.e. z &gt;
4.5). The contribution of these elusive systems to the SFRD is substantial and
can be as high as 40% of the previously known SFRD based on UV-luminous
galaxies. The mere existence of such heavily obscured galaxies in the first two
billion years after the Big Bang opens new avenues to investigate the early
phases of galaxy formation and evolution, and to understand the links between
these systems and the massive galaxies which ceased their star formation at
later cosmic times.

          <p>In image processing, source detections are inevitably affected by the
presence of the geometric boundaries in the images, including the physical
boundaries of the CCD, and the boundaries of masked regions due to column
defects, bright diffraction spikes, etc.. These boundary conditions make the
source detection process not statistically isotropic. It can lead to additive
shear bias near the boundaries. We build a phenomenological model to understand
the bias, and propose a simple method to effectively eliminate the influence of
geometric boundaries on shear measurement. We demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of this method using both simulations and the z-band imaging data
from the third data release of the DECam Legacy Survey.
