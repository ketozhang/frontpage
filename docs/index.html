          <p>It has been pointed out that hypermagnetic helicity decay at the electroweak
symmetry breaking may have produced the observed baryon asymmetry of the
Universe through the chiral anomaly in the standard model of particle physics.
Although fully helical magnetic field that can adequately produce the observed
baryon asymmetry is not strong enough to explain the origin of the
intergalactic magnetic field inferred by the Fermi satellite, the mixture of
helical and nonhelical primordial magnetic fields may explain both baryogenesis
and the intergalactic magnetic fields simultaneously. We first show that such a
scenario is ruled out by the constraint on the amplitude of baryon isocurvature
perturbations produced by the primordial magnetic fields to avoid
overproduction of deuterium at the big bang nucleosynthesis. Then we show that
any attempt to explain the origin of intergalactic magnetic field by primordial
magnetogenesis before the electroweak symmetry breaking does not work due to
the above constraint irrespective of the helicity and baryogenesis mechanism.

          <p>Lagrangian algorithms to simulate the evolution of cold dark matter (CDM) are
invaluable tools to generate large suites of mock halo catalogues. However,
their precision may not be up to the challenge of upcoming surveys. In this
paper, we first show that the main limitation of current schemes is their
inability to model the evolution of overdensities in the initial density field,
a limit that can be circumvented by detecting halo particles in the initial
conditions. We thus propose a new scheme, dubbed \muscleups, which reproduces
the results from Lagrangian perturbation theory on large scales, while
improving the modelling of the overdensities on small scales. \muscleups\ uses
the extended Press and Schechter (EPS) formalism, adapted to a Lagrangian
picture. For regions exceeding a collapse threshold in the density smoothed at
a radius $R$, we consider all particles within a radius $R$ collapsed.
Exploiting a multi-scale smoothing of the initial density, we build a halo
catalogue on the fly by optimizing the selection of halo candidates. This
allows us to generate a density field with a halo mass function that matches
one measured in $N$-body simulations. We further explicitly gather particles in
each halo together in a profile, providing a numerical, Lagrangian-based
implementation of the halo model. Compared to previous semi-analytical
Lagrangian methods, we find that \muscleups\ improves the recovery of the
statistics of the density field at the level of the probability density
function (PDF), the power spectrum, and the cross correlation with the $N$-body
result.

          <p>A model-independent test of the cosmic curvature parameter $\Omega_k$ is very
important in cosmology. In order to estimate cosmic curvature from cosmological
probes like standard candles, one has to be able to measure the luminosity
distance $D_L(z)$, it's derivative with respect to redshift $D'_L(z)$ and
independently know the expansion rate $H(z)$ at the same redshift. In this
paper, we study how such an idea could be implemented with the future
generation of space-based DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave
Observatory (DECIGO), in combination with cosmic chronometers providing
cosmology-independent $H(z)$ data. Our results show that for the Hubble diagram
of simulated DECIGO data acting as a new type of standard siren, it would be
able to constrain cosmic curvature with the precision of $\Delta \Omega_k=
0.09$ with the currently available sample of 31 measurements of Hubble
parameters. In the framework of the third generation ground-based gravitational
wave detectors, the spatial curvature is constrained to be $\Delta\Omega_k=
0.13$ for Einstein Telescope (ET). More interestingly, compared to other
approaches aiming for model-independent estimations of spatial curvature, our
analysis also achieves the reconstruction of the evolution of $\Omega_k(z)$, in
the framework of a model-independent method of Gaussian processes (GP) without
assuming a specific form. Therefore, one can expect that the newly emerged
gravitational wave astronomy can become useful in local measurements of cosmic
curvature using distant sources.

          <p>We present the results of a joint analysis of $Chandra$ X-ray and South Pole
Telescope (SPT) SZ observations targeting the first sample of galaxy clusters
at $0.3 &lt; z &lt; 1.3$, selected to be the progenitors of well-studied nearby
clusters based on their expected accretion rate. We develop a new procedure in
order to tackle the analysis challenge that is estimating the intracluster
medium (ICM) properties of low-mass and high-redshift clusters with ${\sim}150$
X-ray counts. One of the dominant sources of uncertainty on the ICM density
profile estimated with a standard X-ray analysis with such shallow X-ray data
is due to the systematic uncertainty associated with the ICM temperature
obtained through the analysis of the background-dominated X-ray spectrum. We
show that we can decrease the uncertainty on the density profile by a factor
${\sim}5$ with a joint deprojection of the X-ray surface brightness profile
measured by $Chandra$ and the SZ integrated Compton parameter available in the
SPT cluster catalog. We apply this technique to the whole sample of 67 clusters
in order to track the evolution of the ICM core density during cluster growth.
We confirm that the evolution of the gas density profile is well modeled by the
combination of a fixed core and a self-similarly evolving non-cool core
profile. We show that the fraction of cool-cores in this sample is remarkably
stable with redshift although clusters have gained a factor ${\sim}4$ in total
mass over the past ${\sim}9$ Gyr. This new sample combined with our new
X-ray/SZ analysis procedure and extensive multi-wavelength data will allow us
to address fundamental shortcomings in our current understanding of cluster
formation and evolution at $z &gt; 1$.

          <p>While during inflation a phase of increasing gauge coupling allows for a
scale-invariant hyperelectric spectrum, when the coupling decreases a flat
hypermagnetic spectrum can be generated for typical wavelengths larger than the
effective horizon. After the gauge coupling flattens out the late-time
hypermagnetic power spectra outside the horizon in the radiation epoch are
determined by the hyperelectric fields at the end of inflation whereas the
opposite is true in the case of decreasing coupling. Instead of imposing an
abrupt freeze after inflation, we consider a smooth evolution of the mode
functions by positing that the gauge couplings and their conformal time
derivatives are always continuous together with the background extrinsic
curvature. The amplified gauge power spectra are classified according to their
transformation properties under the duality symmetry. After clarifying the role
of the comoving and of the physical spectra in the formulation of the relevant
magnetogenesis constraints, the parameter space of the scenario is scrutinized.
It turns out that a slightly blue hyperelectric spectrum during inflation may
lead to a quasi-flat hypermagnetic spectrum prior to matter radiation equality
and before the relevant wavelengths reenter the effective horizon. In this
framework the gauge coupling is always perturbative but the induced large-scale
magnetic fields can be of the order of a few hundredths of a nG and over
typical length scales between a fraction of the Mpc and $100$ Mpc prior to the
gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy.

previous reports of anomalous inefficiencies and flux scatter for transients on
bright galaxies. We compare HR distributions of the bright and faint halves of

consistent with no difference at the 2 sigma level. We also perform a

          <p>Ultralight primordial black holes (PBHs)($\lesssim10^9$g) completely
evaporate via Hawking radiation (HR) and produce all the particles in a given
theory regardless of their other interactions. If the right handed (RH)
neutrinos are produced from PBH evaporation, successful baryogenesis via
leptogenesis predicts mass scales of RH neutrinos and black holes. We show
that, given the lepton number violation (generation of RH masses) in the theory
is a consequence of a gauged $U(1)$ breaking which is then followed by the
formation of PBHs, a network of cosmic string naturally gives rise to strong
stochastic gravitational wave (GW) signal, for example, at the level of pulsar
timing arrays (PTA) and LIGO. Apart from that, due to a period of black hole
domination in the early universe, for which baryon asymmetry is independent of
initial PBH density, a break in the GW spectra occurs around MHz frequency.
Therefore, to observe the break along with the usual GW signal by the emission
of gravitons via HR, one needs GW detectors at higher frequencies. Within the
PBH baryogenesis scenario, the recent finding by the NANOGrav PTA of a
stochastic common spectrum process (interpreted as GWs) across many pulsars is
better fitted with string loops of smaller size ($\alpha&lt;0.01$).

mock galaxy redshift surveys constructed from a high-resolution N-body

For galaxies with magnitude ${\rm z\le 21}$ and redshift $0&lt;z\le 1.0$ in the

identifies more than 60\% of the members in about $90\%$ of halos with mass
$\ga 10^{12.5}\msunh$. Detected groups with mass $\ga 10^{12.0}\msunh$ have a
purity (the fraction of true groups) greater than 90\%. The halo mass assigned
to each group has an uncertainty of about 0.2 dex at the high mass end $\ga
10^{13.5}\msunh$ and 0.45 dex at the low mass end. Groups with more than 10
members have a redshift accuracy of $\sim 0.008$. We apply this group finder to
the Legacy Surveys DR8 and find 6.4 Million groups with at least 3 members.

          <p>We compare the dispersion measure (DM) statistics of FRBs detected by the
ASKAP and Parkes radio telescopes. We jointly model their DM distributions,
exploiting the fact that the telescopes have different survey fluence limits
but likely sample the same underlying population. After accounting for the
effects of instrumental temporal and spectral resolution of each sample, we
find that a fit between the modelled and observed DM distribution, using
identical population parameters, provides a good fit to both distributions.
Assuming a one-to-one mapping between DM and redshift for an homogeneous
intergalactic medium (IGM), we determine the best-fit parameters of the
population spectral index, $\hat{\alpha}$, and the power-law index of the burst
energy distribution, $\hat{\gamma}$, for different redshift evolutionary
models. Whilst the overall best-fit model yields
$\hat{\alpha}=2.2_{-1.0}^{+0.7}$ and $\hat{\gamma}=2.0_{-0.1}^{+0.3}$, for a
strong redshift evolutionary model, when we admit the further constraint of
$\alpha=1.5$ we favour the best fit $\hat{\gamma}=1.5 \pm 0.2$ and the case of
no redshift evolution. Moreover, we find no evidence that the FRB population
evolves faster than linearly with respect to the star formation rate over the
DM (redshift) range for the sampled population.

          <p>Alternative theories of gravity predict modifications in the propagation of
gravitational waves (GW) through space-time. One of the smoking-gun predictions
of such theories is the change in the GW luminosity distance to GW sources as a
function of redshift relative to the electromagnetic (EM) luminosity distance
expected from EM probes. We propose a multi-messenger test of the theory of
general relativity from the propagation of gravitational waves by combining EM
and GW observations to resolve these issues from GW sources without EM
counterparts (which are also referred to as dark standard sirens). By using the
relation between the geometric distances accessible from baryon acoustic
oscillation measurements, and luminosity distance measurements from the GW
sources, we can measure any deviation from the general theory of relativity via
the GW sources of unknown redshift that will be detectable by networks of GW
detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. Using this technique, the fiducial
value of the frictional term can be measured to a precision
$\Xi_0=0.98^{+0.04}_{-0.23}$ after marginalizing over redshift dependence,
cosmological parameters, and GW bias parameters with $\sim 3500$ dark standard
sirens of masses $30\,\rm M_\odot$ each distributed up to redshift $z=0.5$. For
a fixed redshift dependence, a value of $\Xi_0=0.99^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ can be
measured with a similar number of dark sirens. Application of our methodology
to the far more numerous dark standard sirens detectable with next generation
GW detectors, such as LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will allow
achievement of higher accuracy than possible from use of bright standard
sirens.

the $&gt;{\rm TeV}$ fluxes of unresolved extragalactic point sources will be
correspondingly enhanced, resulting in an enhancement of the observed EGB

ALP effect on the EGB spectrum. Our results show that the existence of ALPs can
cause the EGB spectrum to deviate from a pure EBL absorption case. The

          <p>Based on the theoretical description of Position-Position-Velocity (PPV)
statistics in Lazarian &amp; Pogosyan (2000), we introduce a new technique called
the Velocity Decomposition Algorithm (VDA) in separating the contribution of
turbulent velocity from density fluctuations. Using MHD turbulence simulations,
we demonstrate its promise in recovering the velocity caustics in various
physical conditions and, in conjunction with the Velocity Gradient Technique
(VGT), its prospects in accurately tracing the magnetic field based on pure
velocity fluctuations. Employing the theoretical framework developed in
Lazarian &amp; Pogosyan (2004), we find that for localized clouds, the velocity
fluctuations are most prominent at the wing part of the spectral line, and they
dominate the density fluctuations. The same velocity dominance applies to
extended HI regions with galactic rotations. Our numerical experiment
demonstrates that velocity channels arising from the cold phase of atomic
hydrogen (HI) are still strongly affected by the velocity caustics in small
scales. We apply the VDA to the HI GALFA-DR2 data corresponding to the
high-velocity cloud HVC186+19-114 and high latitude galactic diffuse HI data.
Our study confirms the crucial role of velocity caustics in forming linear
structures observed within PPV cubes. We discuss the implications of the VDA
for both magnetic field studies and predicting polarized galactic emission that
acts as the foreground for the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) studies.
Besides, we address the controversy related to the nature of the filaments in
HI channel maps and explain the importance of velocity caustics in the
formation of structures in PPV data cubes. The VDA method will allow
astronomers to obtain velocity caustics from almost every piece of
spectroscopic PPV data and allows direct investigation of the turbulent
velocity field in observations.

          <p>The non-polarized points (NPP) of the $Q$ and $U$ Stokes parameters of the
CMB can be classified according to the geometry of the polarization field. We
describe a procedure to identify these points in the pixelized sky and present
the shape of the polarization angles in the vicinity of NPPs. We design a test
of Gaussianity using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We show that the total
number density of non-polarized points of the E- and B-families is closely
related to the presence of lensing and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We
further show that in the absence of lensing, the total number of NPPs of all
types does not depend on $r$, while the lensing effect removes this degeneracy.
This analysis is applied to the CMB maps from the 2018 Planck release. We show
that there is general consistency of SMICA and NILC maps compared to a
reference set of Gaussian simulations. The strongest discrepancies are found in
the Commander (with corresponding $p$-value $0.07$) and NILC ($p = 0.15$) maps.

          <p>We present a new statistical analysis of the large-scale stellar mass
distribution in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (data release 7). A set of
volume-limited samples shows that the stellar mass of galaxies is concentrated
in a range of galaxy luminosities that is very different from the range
selected by the usual analysis of galaxy positions. Nevertheless, the two-point
correlation function is a power-law with the usual exponent
$\gamma=1.71$--$1.82$, which varies with luminosity. The mass concentration
property allows us to make a meaningful analysis of the angular distribution of
the full flux-limited sample. With this analysis, after suppressing the shot
noise, we extend further the scaling range and thus obtain $\gamma=1.83$ and a
clustering length \redc{$r_0= 5.8$--$7.0\,h^{-1}$Mpc.} Fractional statistical
moments of the coarse-grained stellar mass density exhibit multifractal
scaling. Our results support a multifractal model with a transition to
homogeneity at about $10\,h^{-1}$Mpc.

          <p>We present a new method to determine the probability distribution of the 3-D
shapes of galaxy clusters from the 2-D images using stereology. In contrast to
the conventional approach of combining different data sets (such as X-rays,
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and lensing) to fit a 3-D model of a galaxy cluster
for each cluster, our method requires only a single data set, such as X-ray
observations or Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect observations, consisting of
sufficiently large number of clusters. Instead of reconstructing the 3-D shape
of an individual object, we recover the probability distribution function (PDF)
of the 3-D shapes of the observed galaxy clusters. The shape PDF is the
relevant statistical quantity which can be compared with the theory and used to
test the cosmological models. We apply this method to publicly available
\emph{Chandra} X-ray data of 89 well resolved galaxy clusters. Assuming
ellipsoidal shapes, we find that our sample of galaxy clusters is a mixture of
prolate and oblate shapes, with a preference for oblateness with the most
probable ratio of principle axes 1.4 : 1.3 : 1. The ellipsoidal assumption is
not essential to our approach and our method is directly applicable to
non-ellipsoidal shapes. Our method is insensitive to the radial density and
temperature profiles of the cluster. Our method is sensitive to the changes in
shape of the X-ray emitting gas from inner to outer regions and we find
evidence for variation in the 3-D shape of the X-ray emitting gas with distance
from the centre.

not only describe the fundamental invariance of the theory under phase-space
reparameterisations, but also generate the dynamics of the system. In the first
part of this work we study the symplectic structure associated with linear
canonical transformations. After reviewing salient mathematical properties of
the symplectic group in a pedagogical way, we introduce the squeezing

case of cosmological perturbations, and focus on scalar field fluctuations

different vacuum states, and that this leaves an ambiguity in observational
predictions if initial conditions are set at a finite time in the past. We also
discuss how the effectiveness of the quantum-to-classical transition of
cosmological perturbations depends on the set of canonical variables used to

          <p>We study the evolution of the colour-magnitude relation for galaxies in the
VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) by introducing the concept
of the bright edge, and use this to derive constraints on the quenching of star
formation activity in galaxies over the redshift range $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.1$. The
bright-edge of the colour-magnitude diagram evolves with little dependence on
galaxy colour, and therefore on the amount of star formation taking place in
bright galaxies. We modelled this evolution with delayed exponential star
formation histories (SFHs), to better understand the time-scale of the turn-off
in star formation activity. We show that using SFHs without quenching, the
transition from the blue cloud to the red sequence is too slow. This indicates
that a scenario purely driven by the consumption of the gas inside each galaxy
does not reproduce the observed evolution of the colour-magnitude bright edge.
Among the quenching scenarios explored, the one that best matches the
observations assumes that galaxies stop their star formation at a randomly
selected time with a uniform distribution up to $2.5$ Gyr. We argue that
quenching is required over a wide range of stellar masses. Qualitatively
similar evolution of the bright edge is found in the predictions of a
semi-analytical galaxy formation model, but quantitatively there are marked
differences with the observations. This illustrates the utility of the bright
edge as a test of galaxy formation models. The evolution changes and no longer
matches the observed trend if feedback from heating by active galactic nuclei
is turned off.

compactifications are the correlations between the model parameters and the
postinflationary evolution of the universe. Thus, the postinflationary
evolution depends on the inflationary model parameters and accurate
inflationary predictions require that this be incorporated in the evolution of
the primordial spectrum. The fibre inflation model is a promising model of
inflation constructed in type IIB string theory. This model has two interesting
features in its postinflationary evolution. The reheating temperature of the
model is directly correlated with the model parameters. The model also
necessarily predicts some dark radiation, which can be sizable for certain
choices of discrete parameters in the model. We analyze this model in detail
using publicly available codes - ModeChord and CosmoMC with the latest
Planck+BICEP2/Keck array data to constrain the model parameters and $N_{\rm
pivot}$ (the number of $e$-foldings between horizon exit of the CMB pivot mode
and the end of inflation). We also carry out the same analysis using the
publicly available code Cobaya. We find the results of both the analysis to be
in agreement. Our analysis provides the basic methods necessary to extract
precise inflationary prediction in string models incorporating correlations

the quantum potential is never trivial, so that it plays the r\^ole of
intrinsic energy. Such a key property selects the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) quantum
potential $Q[g_{jk}]$ as the natural candidate for the dark energy. This leads
to the WDW Hamilton-Jacobi equation with a vanishing kinetic term, and with the
identification $$ \Lambda=-\frac{\kappa^2}{\sqrt{\bar g}}Q[g_{jk}] \ . $$ This
shows that the cosmological constant is a quantum correction of the Einstein
tensor, reminiscent of the von Weizs\"acker correction to the kinetic term of
the Thomas-Fermi theory. The quantum potential also defines the Madelung
pressure tensor. The geometrical origin of the vacuum energy density, a
strictly non-perturbative phenomenon, provides strong evidence that it is due
to a graviton condensate. Time independence of the regularized WDW equation
suggests that the ratio between the Planck length and the Hubble radius may be
a time constant, providing an infrared/ultraviolet duality. We speculate that
such a duality is related to the local to global geometry theorems for constant
curvatures, showing that understanding the universe geometry is crucial for a

          <p>We measure the anisotropic clustering of the quasar sample from Data Release
16 (DR16) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV extended Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). A sample of $343,708$ spectroscopically confirmed
quasars between redshift $0.8&lt;z&lt;2.2$ are used as tracers of the underlying dark
matter field. In comparison with DR14 sample, the final sample doubles the
number of objects as well as the survey area. In this paper, we present the
analysis in configuration space by measuring the two-point correlation function
and decompose using the Legendre polynomials. For the full-shape analysis of
the Legendre multipole moments, we measure the BAO distance and the growth rate
of the cosmic structure. At an effective redshift of $z_{\rm eff}=1.48$, we
measure the comoving angular diameter distance $D_{\rm M}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm
drag} = 30.66\pm0.88$, the Hubble distance $D_{\rm H}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag}
= 13.11\pm0.52$, and the growth rate $f\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.439\pm0.048$.
The accuracy of these measurements is confirmed using an extensive set of mock
simulations developed for the quasar sample. The uncertainties on the distance
and growth rate measurements have been reduced substantially ($\sim 45\%$ and
$\sim30\%$) with respect to the DR14 results. We also perform a BAO-only
analysis to cross check the robustness of the methodology of the full-shape
analysis. Combining our analysis with the Fourier space analysis, we arrive at

          <p>We present a method that allows us for the first time to estimate the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the harmonic-space galaxy bispectrum induced by
gravity, a complementary probe to already well established Fourier-space
clustering analyses. We show how to do it considering only $\sim1000$ triangle
configurations in multipole space, corresponding to a computational speedup of
a factor $\mathcal{O}(10^2)-\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, depending on the redshift bin,
when including mildly non-linear scales. Assuming observational specifications
consistent with forthcoming spectroscopic and photometric galaxy surveys like
the Euclid satellite and the Square Kilometre Array (phase 1), we show: that
given a single redshift bin, spectroscopic surveys outperform photometric
surveys; and that -- due to shot-noise and redshift bin width balance -- bins
at redshifts $z\sim1$ bring higher cumulative SNR than bins at lower redshifts
$z \sim 0.5$. Our results for the largest cumulative SNR $\sim 15$ suggest that
the harmonic-space bispectrum is detectable within narrow ($\Delta z \sim
0.01$) spectroscopic redshift bins even when including only mildly non-linear
scales. Tomographic reconstructions and inclusion of highly non-linear scales
will further boost detectability with upcoming galaxy surveys. In addition, we
discuss how, using the Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform, a detection analysis only
requires a $1 \times 1$ covariance matrix for a single redshift bin.

          <p>The reconstruction of a k-essence inflationary universe, considering the
unification between the swampland criteria and the attractor given by the
scalar spectral index $n_S(N)$ together with the slow roll parameter
$\epsilon(N)$in terms of the number of $e$-folds $N$ is studied. In the context
of a coupling of the form $L(\phi)\,X$ in the k-essence model, we find the
effective potential $V$ and the coupling parameter $L$ in terms of the scalar
spectral index and the slow roll parameter under a general formalism. To apply
the unification in our model, we consider some examples in order to rebuild the
effective potential $V(\phi)$ and the coupling parameter $L(\phi)$ as a
function of the inflaton field $\phi$. Here, we find that the reconstruction
gives rise to an exponential potential and also to natural and hyperbolic
inflation, respectively. Thus, in this article we show that it is possible to
unify the theoretical foundations from the swampland criteria and the
observational parameters corroborated by observations, in the reconstruction of
an inflationary universe.

          <p>We construct a generalization of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, wherein we
simultaneously replace the spatially flat Robertson-Walker metric with its
simplest anisotropic generalization (LRS Bianchi I metric), and couple the cold
dark matter to the gravity in accordance with the energy-momentum squared
gravity (EMSG) of the form $f(T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})\propto
T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}$. These two modifications -- namely, two new stiff
fluid-like terms of different nature -- can mutually cancel out, i.e., the
shear scalar can be screened completely, and reproduce mathematically exactly
the same Friedmann equation of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. This evades the
BBN limits on the anisotropy, and thereby provides an opportunity to manipulate
the cosmic microwave background quadrupole temperature fluctuation at the
desired amount. We further discuss the consequences of the model on the very
early times and far future of the Universe. This study presents also an example
of that the EMSG of the form $f(T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})\propto
T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}$, as well as similar type other constructions, is not
necessarily relevant only to very early Universe but may even be considered in
the context of a major problem of the current cosmology related to the
present-day Universe, the so-called $H_0$ problem.

          <p>A comprehensive analysis of cosmological and collider constraints is
presented for three simplified models characterised by a dark matter candidate
(real scalar, Majorana fermion and real vector) and a coloured mediator
(fermion, scalar and fermion respectively) interacting with the right-handed up
quark of the Standard Model. Constraints from dark matter direct and indirect
detection and relic density are combined with bounds originating from the
re-interpretation of a full LHC run 2 ATLAS search targeting final states with
multiple jets and missing transverse energy. Projections for the
high-luminosity phase of the LHC are also provided to assess future exclusion
and discovery reaches, which show that analogous future search strategies will
not allow for a significant improvement compared with the present status. From
the cosmological point of view, we demonstrate that thermal dark matter is
largely probed (and disfavoured) by constraints from current direct and
indirect detection experiments. These bounds and their future projections have
moreover the potential of probing the whole parameter space when combined with
the expectation of the high-luminosity phase of the LHC.

          <p>It has long been known that the sharpened tension between the observed and
inferred values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ can be alleviated if a fraction of
dark matter particles of type $\chi$ were produced non-thermally in association
with photons $\gamma$ through the decays of a heavy and relatively long-lived
state, viz. $X \to \chi + \gamma$. It was recently proposed that this model can
also resolve the longstanding lithium problem if $M= 4$ MeV and $m = 0.04$ keV,
where $M$ and $m$ are respectively the masses of $X$ and $\chi$. We confront
this proposal with experiment and demonstrate that cold dark matter decaying
before recombination cannot resolve the $H_0$ problem. Moreover, we show that
the best case scenario for alleviating the $H_0$ tension within the context of
cold dark matter decaying before recombination arises when the particles decay
exclusively into dark radiation, while leaving completely unmodified the
production of light elements. To this end we calculate the general functional
form describing the number of equivalent light neutrino species $\Delta
N_{eff}$ carried by $\chi$. We show that to resolve the $H_0$ tension at the
$1\sigma$ level a 55% correction in $m$ is needed and that the required $\Delta
N_{eff}$ is excluded at 95% CL by Planck data. We argue in favor of a more
complex model of dynamical dark matter to relax the $H_0$ tension.

          <p>Recent measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Anisotropies power spectra
measured by the Planck satellite show a preference for a closed universe at
more than $99 \%$ Confidence Level. Such a scenario is however in disagreement
with several low redshift observables, including luminosity distances of Type
Ia Supernovae. Here we show that Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) models can ease
the discrepancies between Planck and Supernovae Ia data in a closed Universe.
Therefore IDE cosmologies remain as very appealing scenarios, as they can
provide the solution to a number of observational tensions in different
fiducial cosmologies. The results presented here strongly favour broader
analyses of cosmological data, and suggest that relaxing the usual flatness and
vacuum energy assumptions can lead to a much better agreement among theory and
observations.
