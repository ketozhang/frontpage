          <p>Tidal disruption and subsequent accretion of planetesimals by white dwarfs
can reveal the elemental abundances of rocky bodies in exoplanetary systems.
Those abundances provide information on the composition of the nebula from
which the systems formed, analogous to how meteorite abundances inform our
understanding of the early Solar System. We report the detection of Li, Na, K
and Ca in the atmosphere of the white dwarf Gaia DR2 4353607450860305024, which
we ascribe to accretion of a planetesimal. Using model atmospheres, we
determine abundance ratios of these elements, and with the exception of Li,
they are consistent with meteoritic values in the Solar System. We compare the
measured Li abundance to measurements in old stars and to expectations from Big
Bang nucleosynthesis.

          <p>It is of great interest to explore matter in nontrivial quantum arrangements,
including Schrodinger cat-like states. Such states are sensitive to decoherence
from their environment. Recently, in Ref. [1] we computed the rate of
decoherence of a piece of superposed matter that primarily only interacts
gravitationally, a dark-matter-Schrodinger-cat-state (DMSCS), within the
nonrelativistic approximation. In this work we improve this to a general
relativistic analysis. We firstly derive a single particle relativistic
Schrodinger equation for a probe particle that passes through the DMSCS; the
interaction is provided by the weak field metric of general relativity from the
source. For a static DMSCS we find a neat generalization of our previous
results. We then turn to the interesting new case of a time dependent DMSCS,
which can be provided by a coherently oscillating axion field leading to
superposed time dependent oscillations in the metric; a truly quantum-general
relativistic phenomenon. We use scattering theory to derive the decoherence
rate in all these cases. When the DMSCS is in a superposition of distinct
density profiles, we find that the decoherence rate can be appreciable. We then
consider the novel special case in which the density is not in a superposition,
but the phase of its field oscillation is; this is a property that cannot be
decohered within the nonrelativistic framework. We find that if the probe
particle and/or the DMSCS's velocity dispersion is slow, then the rate of
decoherence of the phase is exponentially suppressed. However, if both the
probe and the DMSCS's velocity dispersion are relativistic, then the phase can
decohere more rapidly. As applications, we find that diffuse galactic axions
with superposed phases are robust against decoherence, while dense boson stars
and regions near black hole horizons are not, and we discuss implications for
experiment.

          <p>The distribution of ionised hydrogen during the epoch of reionization (EoR)
has a complex morphology. We propose to measure the three-dimensional topology
of ionised regions using the Betti numbers. These quantify the topology using
the number of components, tunnels and cavities in any given field. Based on the
results for a set of reionization simulations we find that the Betti numbers of
the ionisation field show a characteristic evolution during reionization, with
peaks in the different Betti numbers characterising different stages of the
process. The shapes of their evolutionary curves can be fitted with simple
analytical functions. We also observe that the evolution of the Betti numbers
shows a clear connection with the percolation of the ionized and neutral
regions and differs between different reionization scenarios. Through these
properties, the Betti numbers provide a more useful description of the topology
than the widely studied Euler characteristic or genus. The morphology of the
ionisation field will be imprinted on the redshifted 21-cm signal from the EoR.
We construct mock image cubes using the properties of the low-frequency element
of the future Square Kilometre Array and show that we can extract the Betti
numbers from such datasets if an observation time of 1000 h is used. Even for a
much shorter observation time of 100 h, some topological information can be
extracted for the middle and later stages of reionization. We also find that
the topological information extracted from the mock 21-cm observations can put
constraints on reionization models.

          <p>Both theoretical and observational results suggest that high-redshift radio
galaxies (HzRGs) inhabit overdense regions of the universe and might be the
progenitors of local, massive galaxies residing in the centre of galaxy
clusters. In this paper we present CO(3-2) line observations of the HzRG TXS
0828+193 (z=2.57) and its environment using the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array. In contrast to previous observations, we detect
CO emission associated with the HzRG and derive a molecular gas mass of
$(0.9\pm0.3)\times10^{10}\,\rm M_{\odot}$. Moreover, we confirm the presence of
a previously detected off-source CO emitting region (companion #1), and detect
three new potential companions. The molecular gas mass of each companion is
comparable to that of the HzRG. Companion #1 is aligned with the axis of the
radio jet and has stellar emission detected by Spitzer. Thus this source might
be a normal star-forming galaxy or alternatively a result of jet-induced star
formation. The newly found CO sources do not have counterparts in any other
observing band and could be high-density clouds in the halo of TXS 0828+193 and
thus potentially linked to the large-scale filamentary structure of the cosmic
web.

          <p>Axions have for some time been considered a plausible candidate for dark
matter. They can be produced through misalignment, but it has been argued that
when inflation occurs before a Peccei-Quinn transition, appreciable production
can result from cosmic strings. This has been the subject of extensive
simulations. But there are reasons to be skeptical about the possible role of
axion strings. We review and elaborate on these questions, and argue that
parametrically strings are already accounted for by the assumption of random
misalignment angles. The arguments are base on considerations of the collective
modes of the string solutions, on computations of axion radiation in particular
models, and reviews of simulations.

          <p>The gravitino problem is investigated in the framework of Extended Gravity
cosmologies. In particular, we consider $f(R)$ gravity, the most natural
extension of the Hilbert-Einstein action, and $f(\cal T)$ gravity, the
extension of teleparallel equivalent gravity. Since in these theories the
expansion laws of the Universe are modified, as compared to the standard
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology, it follows that also the thermal history of particles
gets modified. We show that $f(R)$ models allow to avoid the late abundance of
gravitinos. In particular, we found that for an appropriate choice of the
parameters characterizing the $f(R)$ model, the gravitino abundance turns out
to be independent of the reheating temperature. A similar behavior is achieved
also in the context of $f(\cal T)$ gravity. In this perspective, we can
conclude that geometric corrections to standard General Relativity (and to
Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity) can improve shortcomings both in
cosmology and in unified theories beyond the Standard Model of particles.

          <p>We show an efficient way to compute wide-angle or all-sky statistics of
galaxy intrinsic alignment in three-dimensional configuration space. For this
purpose, we expand the two-point correlation function using a newly introduced
spin-dependent tripolar spherical harmonic basis. Therefore, the angular
dependences on the two line-of-sight (LOS) directions pointing to each pair of
objects, which are degenerate with each other in the conventional analysis
under the small-angle or plane-parallel (PP) approximation, are unambiguously
decomposed. By means of this, we, for the first time, compute the wide-angle
auto and cross correlations between intrinsic ellipticities, number densities
and velocities of galaxies, and compare them with the PP-limit results. For the
ellipticity-ellipticity and density-ellipticity correlations, we find more than
$10\%$ deviation from the PP-limit results if the opening angle between two LOS
directions exceeds $30^\circ - 50^\circ$. It is also shown that even if the
PP-limit result is strictly zero, the non-vanishing correlation is obtained
over the various scales, arising purely from the curved-sky effects. Our
results indicate the importance of the data analysis not relying on the PP
approximation in order to determine the cosmological parameters more precisely
and/or find new physics via ongoing and forthcoming wide-angle galaxy surveys.

$A_\mu^a$ are coupled to cold dark matter by the term

-\frac{1}{2}A^\mu_ a A^a_\mu$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{L}}_{m}$ is the cold dark
matter Lagrangian. From here, we derive the general covariant form of the novel
interaction term sourcing the field equations. This result is quite general in
the sense that encompasses Abelian and non-Abelian vector fields. In
particular, we investigate the effects of this type of coupling in a simple
dark energy model based on three copies of canonical Maxwell fields to realize
isotropic expansion. The cosmological background dynamics of the model is
examined by means of a dynamical system analysis to determine the stability of
the emergent cosmological solutions. As an interesting result, we find that the
coupling function leads to the existence of a novel scaling solution during the
dark matter dominance. Furthermore, the critical points show an early
contribution of the vector field in the form of dark radiation and a stable de
Sitter-type attractor at late times mimicking dark energy. The cosmological
evolution of the system as well as the aforementioned features are verified by
numerical computations. Observational constraints are also discussed to put the
model in a more phenomenological context in the light of future observations.

          <p>We study inflationary solution in an extension of mimetic gravity with the
higher derivative interactions coupled to gravity. Because of the higher
derivative interactions, the setup is free from the ghost and gradient
instabilities while it hosts a number of novel properties. The dispersion
relation of scalar perturbations develops quartic momentum correction similar
to the setup of ghost inflation. Furthermore, the tilt of tensor perturbations
can take either signs with a modified consistency relation between the tilt and
the amplitude of tensor perturbations. Despite the presence of higher
derivative interactions coupled to gravity, the tensor perturbations propagate
with a speed equal to the speed of light as required by the LIGO observations.
Furthermore, the higher derivative interactions induce non-trivial interactions
in cubic Hamiltonian, generating non-Gaussianities in various shapes such as
the equilateral, orthogonal, and squeezed configurations with observable
amplitudes.

          <p>With the enhancement mechanism provided by a non-canonical kinetic term with
a peak, the amplitude of primordial curvature perturbations can be enhanced by
seven-orders of magnitude at small scales while keeping to be consistent with
observations at large scales. The peak function and inflationary potential are
not restricted in this mechanism. We use the Higgs model and T-model as
examples to show how abundant primordial black hole dark matter with different
mass and induced secondary gravitational waves with different peak frequencies
are generated. We also show that the enhanced power spectrum for the primordial
curvature perturbations and the energy density of the induced secondary
gravitational waves can have either a sharp peak or a broad peak. The
primordial black holes with the mass around $10^{-14}-10^{-12} M_{\odot}$
produced with the enhancement mechanism can make up almost all dark matter, and
the induced secondary gravitational waves accompanied with the production of
primordial black holes can be tested by the pulsar timing arrays and spaced
based gravitational wave observatory. Therefore, the mechanism can be tested by
primordial black hole dark matter and gravitational wave observations.
