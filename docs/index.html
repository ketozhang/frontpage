          <p>The Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) is a four-telescope array
observing the largest angular scales ($2 \lesssim \ell \lesssim 200$) of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. These scales encode information
about reionization and inflation during the early universe. The instrument
stability necessary to observe these angular scales from the ground is achieved
through the use of a variable-delay polarization modulator (VPM) as the first
optical element in each of the CLASS telescopes. Here we develop a demodulation
scheme used to extract the polarization timestreams from the CLASS data and
apply this method to selected data from the first two years of observations by
the 40 GHz CLASS telescope. These timestreams are used to measure the $1/f$
noise and temperature-to-polarization ($T\rightarrow P$) leakage present in the
CLASS data. We find a median knee frequency for the pair-differenced
demodulated linear polarization of 15.12 mHz and a $T\rightarrow P$ leakage of
$&lt;3.8\times10^{-4}$ (95\% confidence) across the focal plane. We examine the
sources of $1/f$ noise present in the data and find the component of $1/f$ due
to atmospheric precipitable water vapor (PWV) has an amplitude of $203 \pm 12
\mathrm{\mu K_{RJ}\sqrt{s}}$ for 1 mm of PWV when evaluated at 10 mHz;
accounting for $\sim32\%$ of the $1/f$ noise in the central pixels of the focal
plane. The low level of $T\rightarrow P$ leakage and $1/f$ noise achieved
through the use of a front-end polarization modulator enables the observation
of the largest scales of the CMB polarization from the ground by the CLASS
telescopes.

          <p>We present validation tests of emulator-based halo model method for
cosmological parameter inference, assuming hypothetical measurements of the
projected correlation function of galaxies, $w_{\rm p}(R)$, and the
galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, $\Delta\!\Sigma(R)$, from the spectroscopic SDSS
galaxies and the Hyper Suprime-Cam Year1 (HSC-Y1) galaxies. To do this, we use
\textsc{Dark Emulator} developed in Nishimichi et al. based on an ensemble of
$N$-body simulations, which is an emulation package enabling a fast, accurate
computation of halo clustering quantities for flat-geometry $w$CDM cosmologies.
Adopting the halo occupation distribution, the emulator allows us to obtain
model predictions of $\Delta\!\Sigma$ and $w_{\rm p}$ for the SDSS-like
galaxies at a few CPU seconds for an input set of parameters. We present
performance and validation of the method by carrying out Markov Chain Monte
Carlo analyses of the mock signals measured from a variety of mock catalogs
that mimic the SDSS and HSC-Y1 galaxies. We show that the halo model method can
recover the underlying true cosmological parameters to within the 68\% credible
interval, except for the mocks including the assembly bias effect (although we
consider the unrealistically-large amplitude of assembly bias effect). Even for
the assembly bias mock, we demonstrate that the cosmological parameters can be
recovered {\it if} the analysis is restricted to scales $R\gtrsim 10~h^{-1}{\rm
Mpc}$. We also show that, by using a single population of source galaxies to
infer the relative strengths of $\Delta\!\Sigma$ for multiple lens samples at
different redshifts, the joint probes method allows for self-calibration of
photometric redshift errors and multiplicative shear bias. Thus we conclude
that the emulator-based halo model method can be safely applied to the HSC-Y1
dataset, achieving a precision of $\sigma(S_8)\simeq 0.04$.

          <p>Traditional dark matter (DM) models, eg. WIMPs, assume dark matter is weakly
coupled to the standard model so that elastic scattering between DM and baryons
can be described perturbatively by Born approximation. Most direct detection
experiments are analyzed according to that assumption. We show that when the
interaction is attractive and strong, DM-nucleus scattering exhibits rich
resonant behavior with a highly non-trivial dependence on atomic mass. The
scattering is non-perturbative in much of the natural parameter range, and a
full numerical calculation is needed. We also show that the extended rather
than point-like nature of nuclei significantly impacts the cross sections and
must therefore be properly taken into account. These effects are particularly
important for dark matter with GeV-scale masses, near the boundary of exclusion
regions from existing direct detection limits. They also affect the
interpretation of CMB constraints, as we show. We report the corrected limits,
which are in some respects weaker and in other respects stronger than previous
bounds in the literature, which were based on perturbation theory and
point-like sources and hence are now superceded. Sexaquark ($uuddss$) DM with
mass $\lesssim 2$ GeV, which exchanges QCD mesons with baryons, remains
unconstrained for most of the parameter space of interest.

          <p>The detection of gravitational waves is considered to be one of the most
magnificent discoveries of the century. Due to the high computational cost of
matched filtering pipeline, there is a hunt for an alternative powerful system.
I present, for the first time, the use of 1D residual neural network for
detection of gravitational waves. Residual networks have transformed many
fields like image classification, face recognition and object detection with
their robust structure. With increase in sensitivity of LIGO detectors we
expect many more sources of gravitational waves in the universe to be detected.
However, deep learning networks are trained only once. When used for
classification task, deep neural networks are trained to predict only a fixed
number of classes. Therefore, when a new type of gravitational wave is to be
detected, this turns out to be a drawback of deep learning. Shallow neural
networks can be used to learn data with simple patterns but fail to give good
results with increase in complexity of data. Remodelling the neural network
with detection of each new type of GW is highly infeasible. In this letter, I
also discuss ways to reduce the time required to adapt to such changes in
detection of gravitational waves for deep learning methods. Primarily, I aim to
create a custom residual neural network for 1-dimensional time series inputs,
which can learn a ton of features from dataset without giving up on increasing
the number of classes or increasing the complexity of data. I use the two class
of binary coalescence signals (Binary Black Hole Merger and Binary Neutron Star
Merger signals) detected by LIGO to check the performance of residual structure
on gravitational waves detection.

flavor oscillation model to very high levels of accuracy. Here, we explore the
possibility that the dark matter in the current universe is made of two
particles, a sterile neutrino and a very light dark matter particle. By using a
3+1 neutrino flavor oscillation model, we study how such a type of dark matter
imprints the solar neutrino fluxes, spectra, and survival probabilities of
electron neutrinos. The current solar neutrino measurements allow us to define
an upper limit for the ratio of the mass of a light dark matter particle
$m_\phi$ and the Fermi constant $G_\phi$, such that $G_\phi/m_\phi $ must be
smaller than $10^{30}\; G_{\rm F}\; eV^{-1}$ to be in agreement with current
solar neutrino data from the Borexino, Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, and
Super-Kamiokande detectors. Moreover, for models with a very small Fermi
constant, the amplitude of the time variability must be lower than $3\%$ to be
consistent with current solar neutrino data. We also found that solar neutrino
detectors like Darwin, able to measure neutrino fluxes in the low energy-range
with high accuracy, will provide additional constraints to this class of models
that complement the ones obtained from the current solar neutrino detectors.

dark matter, and fuzzy dark matter with these tracers, using CJAM and
pyGravSphere for the dynamical analysis. Results. We find substantial evidence
for cold dark matter over self-interacting dark matter and also substantial
evidence for fuzzy dark matter over cold dark matter. We find a virial mass
$M_{200} \sim 10^8\,M_\odot$ and astrophysical factors $J(\alpha_\mathrm{c}^J)
\sim 10^{11}\,M_\odot^2\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-5}$ and $D(\alpha_\mathrm{c}^D) \sim

($r_\mathrm{c} \lesssim 35\,\mathrm{pc}$, 68-% level) or soliton
($r_\mathrm{sol} \lesssim 4.7\,\mathrm{pc}$, 68-% level). These limits are
equivalent to an effective self-interaction coefficient $f\Gamma \lesssim 2.5
\times 10^{-29}\,\mathrm{cm}^3\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{eV}^{-1}\,c^2$ and a
fuzzy dark matter-particle mass $m_\mathrm{a} \gtrsim 8.5 \times
10^{-20}\,\mathrm{eV}\,c^{-2}$. The constraint on self-interaction is
complementary to those from gamma-ray searches. The constraint on fuzzy dark
matter-particle mass is inconsistent with those obtained for larger dwarf
galaxies, suggesting that the flattened density profiles of those galaxies are
not caused by fuzzy dark matter. (Abridged)

          <p>It is well known that the inflationary scenario often displays different sets
of degeneracies in its predictions for CMB observables. These degeneracies
usually arise either because multiple inflationary models predict similar
values for the scalar spectral index $n_{_S}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio
$r$, or because within the same model, the values of $\lbrace n_{_S}, r
\rbrace$ are insensitive to some of the model parameters, making it difficult
for CMB observations alone to constitute a unique probe of inflationary
cosmology. We demonstrate that by taking into account constraints on the
post-inflationary reheating parameters such as the duration of reheating
$N_{_{\rm re}}$, its temperature $T_{_{\rm re}}$ and especially its equation of
state (EOS), $w_{_{\rm re}}$, it is possible to break this degeneracy in
certain classes of inflationary models where identical values of $\lbrace
n_{_S}, r \rbrace$ can correspond to different reheating $w_{_{\rm re}}$. In
particular, we show how reheating constraints can break inflationary
degeneracies in the T-model and the E-model $\alpha$-attractors. Non-canonical
inflation is also studied. The relic gravitational wave (GW) spectrum provides
us with another tool to break inflationary degeneracies. This is because the GW
spectrum is sensitive to the post-inflationary EOS of the universe. Indeed a
stiff EOS during reheating $(w_{_{\rm re}} &gt; 1/3)$ gives rise to a blue tilt in
the spectral index $n_{_{\rm GW}} = \frac{d\log{\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}}}{d\log{k}}
&gt; 0$, while a soft EOS $(w_{_{\rm re}} &lt; 1/3)$ results in a red tilt. Relic GWs
therefore provide us with valuable information about the post-inflationary
epoch, and their spectrum can be used to cure inflationary degeneracies in
$\lbrace n_{_S}, r\rbrace$.

          <p>The swampland conjectures from string theory have had some really interesting
implications on cosmology, in particular on inflationary models. Some models of
inflation have been shown to be incompatible with these criterion while some
have been shown to be severely fine tuned, with most of these problems arising
in single field inflationary models in a General relativistic cosmology. Recent
works have although optimistically shown that single field models in more
general cosmologies can be consistent with these conjectures and hence there is
an optimism that not all such models lie in the swampland. However a paradigm
of inflation which has been shown to not be perfectly okay with the conjectures
is eternal inflation. So in this work, we discuss Tachyonic inflation in the
high energy RS-II Braneworld scenario in the context of the swampland
conjectures while also considering the possibility of swampland consistent
eternal inflation. We show that our concerned regime evades all the prominent
swampland issues for single field inflation being virtually unscathed. After
this, we show that the main conflicts of eternal inflation with the swampland
can easily be resolved in the considered tachyonic scenario and in particular,
we also discuss the exciting prospect of a Generalized Uncertainty Principle
facilitating the notion of Swampland consistent eternal inflation. Our work as
a whole reignites the possibility that there can be a swampland (and possibly,
quantum gravitationally) consistent picture of a "Multiverse".

          <p>In the present paper, we study the inflationary phenomenology of a
$k$-inflation corrected Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory. Non-canonical kinetic
terms are known for producing Jean instabilities or superluminal sound wave
velocities in the aforementioned era, but we demonstrate in this work that by
adding Gauss-Bonnet string corrections and assuming that the non-canonical
kinetic term $\omega X^\gamma$ is in quadratic, one can obtain a ghost free
description. Demanding compatibility with the recent GW170817 event forces one
to accept that the relation $\ddot\xi=H\dot\xi$ for the scalar coupling
function $\xi (\phi)$. As a result, the scalar functions of the theory are
revealed to be interconnected and by assuming a specific form for one of them,
specifies immediately the other. Here, we shall assume that the scalar
potential is directly derivable from the equations of motion, once the
Gauss-Bonnet coupling is appropriately chosen, but obviously the opposite is
feasible as well. As a result, each term entering the equations of motion, can
be written in terms of the scalar field and a relatively tractable
phenomenology is produced. For quadratic kinetic terms, the resulting scalar
potential is quite elegant functionally. Different exponents, which lead to
either a more perplexed solution for the scalar potential, are still a
possibility which was not further studied. We also discuss in brief the
non-Gaussianities issue under the slow-roll and constant-roll conditions
holding true, and we demonstrate that the predicted amount of non-Gaussianities
is significantly enhanced in comparison to the $k$-inflation free
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory.

          <p>In this work we shall study $k$-inflation theories with non-minimal coupling
of the scalar field to gravity, in the presence of only a higher order kinetic
term of the form $\sim \mathrm{const}\times X^{\mu}$, with
$X=\frac{1}{2}\partial_{\mu}\phi\partial^{\mu}\phi$. The study will be focused
in the cases where a scalar potential is included or is absent, and the
evolution of the scalar field will be assumed to satisfy the slow-roll or the
constant-roll condition. In the case of the slow-roll models with scalar
potential, we shall calculate the slow-roll indices, and the corresponding
observational indices of the theory, and we demonstrate that the resulting
theory is compatible with the latest Planck data. The same results are obtained
in the constant-roll case, at least in the presence of a scalar potential. In
the case that models without potential are considered, the results are less
appealing since these are strongly model dependent, and at least for a
power-law choice of the non-minimal coupling, the theory is non-viable.
Finally, due to the fact that the scalar and tensor power spectra are conformal
invariant quantities, we argue that the Einstein frame counterpart of the
non-minimal $k$-inflation models with scalar potential, can be a viable theory,
due to the conformal invariance of the observational indices. The Einstein
frame theory is more involved and thus more difficult to work with it
analytically, so one implication of our work is that we provide evidence for
the viability of another class of $k$-inflation models.

          <p>We use 3,213 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) from the $\it{XMM}$-XXL northern
field to investigate the relation of AGN type with host galaxy properties.
Applying a Bayesian method, we derive the hardness ratios (HRs) and through
these the hydrogen column density ($\rm N_H$) for each source. We consider as
absorbed sources (type-2) those with $\rm N_H &gt; 10^{21.5}\, \rm{cm^{-2}}$. We
examine the star formation rate (SFR) as well the stellar mass (M$_*$)
distributions for both absorbed and unabsorbed sources. Our work indicates that
there is no significant link between the AGN type and these host galaxy
properties. Next, we investigate whether the AGN power, as represented by its
X-ray luminosity, $\rm L_X$, correlates with any deviation of the host galaxy's
place from the so-called Main Sequence of galaxies, and we examine this
separately for the obscured and the unobscured AGN populations. To take into
account the effect of M$_*$ and redshift on SFR, we use the normalised SFR
(SFR$_{norm}$). We find that the correlation between $\rm L_X$ and
SFR$_{norm}$, follows approximately the same trend for both absorbed and
unabsorbed sources, a result that favours the standard AGN unification models.
Finally, we explore the connection between the obscuration, $\rm N_H$, and the
SFR. We find that there is no relation between these, suggesting that the
obscuration is not related to the large scale SFR in the galaxy.

          <p>Dwarf galaxies and their dark matter (DM) halos have the velocity curves of a
different character than those in large galaxies. They are modelled by a simple
pseudo iso-thermal model containing only two parameters that do not allow to
obtain insight into physics of the DM halo. We would like to obtain some
insight into the physical conditions in DM halos of dwarf galaxies by using a
simple physically based model of DM halos. In order to treat a diversity of the
dwarf galaxy velocity profiles in a unifying framework, we apply the polytropic
spheres characterised by the polytropic index $n$ and the relativistic
parameter $\sigma$ as a model of dwarf-galaxy DM halos and match the velocity
of circular geodesics of the polytropes to the velocity curves observed in the
dwarf galaxies from the LITTLE THINGS ensemble. We introduce three classes of
the LITTLE THINGS dwarf galaxies in accord with the polytrope models, due to
the different character of the velocity profile. The first class corresponds to
polytropes having $n &lt; 1$ with linearly increasing velocity along with the
whole profile, the second class has $1 &lt; n &lt; 2$ and the velocity profile
becomes flat in the external region, the third class has $n &gt; 2$ and the
velocity profile reaches a maximum and demonstrated a decline in the external
region. The $\sigma$ parameter has to be strongly non-relativistic ($\sigma &lt;
10^{-8}$) for all dwarf galaxy models -- it varies for the models of each
class, but these variations have a negligible influence on the character of the
velocity profile. Our results indicate the possibility that at least two
different kinds of dark matter are behind the composition of DM halos. The
matches of the observational velocity curves are of the same quality as those
obtained by the pseudo-isothermal, core-like models of dwarf galaxy DM halos.

large numbers at high redshift ($z \approx$ 4 to 7) by ongoing and future
surveys. We consider a LBG sample like that expected from the The Rubin
Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and a selection of LAEs
modelled after the Subaru SILVERRUSH program, but covering a much larger sky
fraction. The tSZ effect is sensitive to a line-of-sight integral of the
ionized gas pressure, and can be measured across large patches of the sky using
multi-frequency CMB surveys. We consider forecast tSZ maps from CMB Stage 4 and
more futuristic observations. Using a suite of hydrodynamical simulations, we
show that the high-redshift galaxies are correlated with the tSZ signal from
reionization, with cross-power amplitude of order $10^{-15}$ at $\ell \sim
1000$. The cross-spectra between LBGs/LAEs with tSZ maps contain information
about the reionization history of the Universe, such as the distribution of
bubble sizes, and could in principle be used to directly measure the timing of
reionization. The amplitude of the signal is small, however, and its
detectability is hindered by low-redshift contributions to tSZ maps and by
instrumental noise. If the the low-redshift contribution to the observed tSZ
signal is suppressed by masking of massive halos, a combination of overlapping
futuristic CMB and galaxy surveys could potentially probe this signal.

          <p>The linear point (LP), defined as the mid-point between the dip and the peak
of the two-point clustering correlation function (TPCF), has been shown to be
an excellent standard ruler for cosmology. In fact, it is nearly
redshift-independent, being weakly sensitive to non-linearities,
scale-dependent halo bias and redshift-space distortions. So far, these
findings were tested assuming that neutrinos are massless; in this paper we
extend the analysis to massive-neutrino cosmologies. In particular, we examine
if the scale-dependent growth induced by neutrinos affects the LP position and
if it is possible to detect the neutrino masses using the shift of the LP
compared to the massless-neutrino case. For our purposes, we employ two sets of
state-of-the-art $N$-body simulations with massive neutrinos. For each of them
we measure the TPCF of cold dark matter (CDM) and halos and, to estimate the
LP, fit the TPCF with a model-independent parametric fit in the range of scales
of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). Overall, we find that the LP retains
its features as a standard ruler even when neutrinos are massive. The cosmic
distances measured with the LP can therefore be employed to constrain the
neutrino mass.

          <p>The galactic 511 keV gamma-ray line was observed since 1970's, and was
identified as the result of electron-positron annihilation, but the origin of
such positrons is still not clear. Apart from the astrophysical explanations,
the possibilities that such positrons come from dark matter (DM) annihilation
are aslo widely studied. Primordial black hole (PBH) is an extensively studied
candidate of DM. With the existence of PBHs, the DM particles may be
gravitationally bound to the PBHs and form halo around PBHs with density
spikes. DM annihilation in these density spikes can enhance the production rate
of positrons from DM particles, but the signal morphology is similar to the
decaying DM. We consider such a mixed model consisting of DM particles and PBHs
and obtain the upper limit from the data of 511 keV gamma-ray line from
INTEGRAL/SPI on the decaying component of DM particles and the constraints on
PBH abundance. These constraints are general and independent of particle DM
models. For the mixed model consisting of excited DM and PBHs, the constraints
on PBH abundance can be down to $O(10^{-17})$ for DM particle with mass around
$1~\mathrm{TeV}$ , which is more stringent than that obtained from the
extragalactic gamma-ray background.

identification of the scalar field coupled though the Pontryagin density with
the axion dark matter, and we discuss the effects of the parametric resonance
on gravitational waves (GWs). When we consider GWs in a coherently oscillating
axion cloud, we confirm that significant resonant amplification of GWs occurs
in a narrow frequency band, and the amplification is restricted to the late
epoch after the passage of the incident waves. We also identify the condition
that an axion cloud spontaneously emits GWs. Once we take into account the
randomness of the spatial phase distribution of the axion oscillations, we find
that the amplification is suppressed compared with the coherent case, but
significant amplification of GWs can still occur. We also examine whether or
not the amplification of GWs is possible in the present universe, taking into
account the history of the universe. We find that resonant amplification is
difficult to be tested from GW observations in the standard scenario of the
axion DM model, in which the axion is the dominant component of DM. However,
there is some parameter window in which the resonant amplification of GWs might
be observed, if the axion is subdominant component of DM, and the axion cloud
formation is delayed until the Hubble rate becomes much smaller than the axion
mass.

          <p>UV luminosity functions provide a wealth of information on the physics of
galaxy formation in the early Universe. Given that this probe indirectly tracks
the evolution of the mass function of dark matter halos, it has the potential
to constrain alternative theories of structure formation. One of such scenarios
is the existence of primordial non-Gaussianity at scales beyond those probed by
observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background. Through its impact on the halo
mass function, such small-scale non-Gaussianity would alter the abundance of
galaxies at high redshifts. In this work we present an application of UV
luminosity functions as measured by the Hubble Space Telescope to constrain the
non-Gaussianity parameter $f_\mathrm{NL}$ for wavenumbers above a cut-off scale
$k_{\rm cut}$. After marginalizing over the unknown astrophysical parameters
and accounting for potential systematic errors, we arrive at a $2\sigma$ bound
of $f_{\rm NL}=71^{+426}_{-237}$ for a cut-off scale $k_{\rm
cut}=0.1\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ in the bispectrum of the primordial gravitational

          <p>Understanding the origin of \feii\ emission is important because it is
crucial to construct the main sequence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs).
Despite several decades of observational and theoretical effort, the location
of the optical iron emitting region and the mechanism responsible for the
positive correlation between the \feii\ strength and the black hole accretion
rate remain open questions as yet. In this letter, we report the optical \feii\
response to the central outburst in PS1-10adi, a candidate tidal disruption
event (TDE) taking place in an AGN at $z = 0.203$ that has aroused extensive
attention. For the first time, we observe that the \feii\ response in the
rising phase of its central luminosity is significantly more prominent than
that in the decline phase, showing a hysteresis effect. We interpret this
hysteresis effect as a consequence of the gradual sublimation of the dust
grains situating at the inner surface of the torus into gas when the luminosity
of the central engine increases. It is the iron element released from the
sublimated dust that contributes evidently to the observed \feii\ emission.
This interpretation, together with the weak response of the \hb\ emission as we
observe, naturally explains the applicability of relative \feii\ strength as a
tracer of the Eddington ratio. In addition, optical iron emission of this
origin renders the \feii\ time lag a potential "standard candle" with
cosmological implications.

use the latest release of Planck maps (PR4), processed with the NPIPE code,
which produces calibrated frequency maps in temperature and polarization for
all Planck channels from 30 GHz to 857 GHz using the same pipeline. We computed
constraints on r using the BB angular power spectrum, and we also discuss
constraints coming from the TT spectrum. Given Planck's noise level, the TT
spectrum gives constraints on r that are cosmic-variance limited (with
$\sigma$(r)=0.093), but we show that the marginalized posterior peaks towards
negative values of r at about the 1.2$\sigma$ level. We derived Planck
constraints using the BB power spectrum at both large angular scales (the
'reionization bump') and intermediate angular scales (the 'recombination bump')
from $\ell$=2 to 150, and find a stronger constraint than that from TT, with
$\sigma$(r)=0.069. The Planck BB spectrum shows no systematic bias, and is
compatible with zero, given both the statistical noise and the systematic
uncertainties. The likelihood analysis using B modes yields the constraint
r&lt;0.158 at 95% confidence using more than 50% of the sky. This upper limit
tightens to r&lt;0.069 when Planck EE, BB, and EB power spectra are combined
consistently, and it tightens further to r&lt;0.056 when the Planck TT power
spectrum is included in the combination. Finally, combining Planck with
BICEP2/Keck 2015 data yields an upper limit of r&lt;0.044.

two- and three-point correlation functions (2PCF and 3PCF) on the basis of the
decomposition formalism of the 3PCF using tri-polar spherical harmonics. We
perform such an analysis with MultiDark Patchy mock catalogues to demonstrate
and understand the benefit of the anisotropic 3PCF. We focus on scales above
$80 h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$, and use information from the shape and the baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) signals of the 2PCF and 3PCF. We also apply density
field reconstruction to increase the signal-noise ratio of BAO in the 2PCF
measurement, but not in the 3PCF measurement. In particular, we study in detail
the constraints on the angular diameter distance and the Hubble parameter. We
build a model of the bispectrum or 3PCF that includes the nonlinear damping of
the BAO signal in redshift space. We carefully account for various
uncertainties in our analysis including theoretical models of the 3PCF, window
function corrections, biases in estimated parameters from the fiducial values,
the number of mock realizations to estimate the covariance matrix, and bin
size. The joint analysis of the 2PCF and 3PCF monopole and quadrupole
components shows a $30\%$ a nd $20\%$ improvement in Hubble parameter
constraints before and after reconstruction of the 2PCF measurements,

          <p>The absence of high Eddington ratio, obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in
local ($z\lesssim0.1$) samples of moderate luminosity AGN has generally been
explained to result from radiation pressure on the dusty gas governing the
level of nuclear ($\lesssim10$pc) obscuration. However, very high accretion
rates are routinely reported among obscured quasars at higher luminosities, and
may require a different feedback mechanism. We compile constraints on
obscuration and Eddington ratio for samples of X-ray, optical, infrared, and
submm selected AGN at quasar luminosities. Whereas moderate luminosity,
obscured AGN in the local universe have a range of lower Eddington ratios
($f_{\rm Edd} \sim 0.001-0.1$), the most luminous ($L_{\rm bol} \gtrsim 10^{46}
$erg s$^{-1}$) IR/submm-bright, obscured quasars out to $z\sim3$ commonly have
very high Eddington ratios ($f_{\rm Edd} \sim 0.1-1$). This apparent lack of
radiation pressure feedback in luminous obscured quasars is likely coupled with
AGN timescales, such that a higher fraction of luminous obscured quasars are
seen due to the short timescale for which quasars are most luminous. Adopting
quasar evolutionary scenarios, extended ($\sim10^{2-3}$pc) obscuration may work
together with the shorter timescales to explain the observed fraction of
obscured, luminous quasars, while outflows driven by radiation pressure will
slowly clear this material over the AGN lifetime.

the strengthened gravitational forces in Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity and the

have a substantial effect on the model differences. Our results indicate that
the tSZ and kSZ power can be used as powerful probes of gravity on large

constant. All HST observations were obtained with the same instrument (WFC3)
and filters (F555W, F814W, F160W) used for imaging of extragalactic Cepheids in
Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) hosts. The HST observations used the WFC3 spatial
scanning mode to mitigate saturation and reduce pixel-to-pixel calibration
errors, reaching a mean photometric error of 5 millimags per observation. We
use new Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, vastly improved since DR2, and the
Period-Luminosity (PL) relation of these Cepheids to simultaneously calibrate
the extragalactic distance ladder and to refine the determination of the Gaia
EDR3 parallax offset. The resulting geometric calibration of Cepheid
luminosities has 1.0% precision, better than any alternative geometric anchor.
Applied to the calibration of SNe~Ia, it results in a measurement of the Hubble
constant of 73.0 +/- 1.4 km/sec/Mpc, in good agreement with conclusions based
on earlier Gaia data releases. We also find the slope of the Cepheid PL
relation in the Milky Way, and the metallicity dependence of its zeropoint, to

combination with the best complementary sources of Cepheid calibration, we
reach 1.8% precision and find H_0=73.2 +/- 1.3 km/sec/Mpc, a 4.2 sigma

          <p>Observation of the cosmic microwave background is consistent with the $R^2$
model. In the $R^2$ model, there exists a dimensionless constant which must be
assigned a very large value to reconcile the model with the data. We show that
the large value for this parameter can be used to propose an extended model.
The scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio of the extended model
have been obtained. Also, we obtain the three-point correlation function of the
curvature perturbation to estimate the primordial non-Gaussianities of the
extended model. It has been shown that the predictions of the extended model
are in agreement with the observations.

          <p>A rapid transition of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ at a
transition redshift $z_t&lt;0.1$ from $w\simeq -1$ at $z&gt;z_t$ to $w&lt;-1$ at $z&lt;z_t$
can lead to a higher value of the Hubble constant while closely mimicking a
Planck18/$\Lambda$CDM form of the comoving distance
$r(z)=\int_0^z\frac{dz'}{H(z')}$ for $z&gt;z_t$. Such a Late $w$ Phantom
Transition ($LwPT$) avoids the discontinuity of $H(z)$ suggested in previous
studies and thus does not require a step in the Pantheon Hubble diagram which
is strongly constrained. We demonstrate that such an ultra low $z$ abrupt
feature of $w(z)$ provides a better fit to cosmological data compared to smooth
late time deformations of $H(z)$ that also address the Hubble tension. The
strongly present day phantom dark energy behavior implied by this class of
models hints towards a rapid approach of a Big Rip singularity which for
$z_t=0.02$ will rip the universe in less than 3.5 billion years. Early hints of
such effect may be observable in the dynamics of the nearest and largest bound
systems (e.g. Virgo structures). The $LwPT$ can be generically induced by a
phantom scalar field frozen by Hubble friction mimicking the cosmological
constant and currently entering its ghost instability phase as Hubble friction
decreases below the field dynamical scale.

          <p>Lagrangian algorithms to simulate the evolution of cold dark matter (CDM) are
invaluable tools to generate large suites of mock halo catalogues. However,
their precision may not be up to the challenge of upcoming surveys. In this
paper, we first show that the main limitation of current schemes is their
inability to model the evolution of overdensities in the initial density field,
a limit that can be circumvented by detecting halo particles in the initial
conditions. We thus propose a new scheme, dubbed \muscleups, which reproduces
the results from Lagrangian perturbation theory on large scales, while
improving the modelling of the overdensities on small scales. \muscleups\ uses
the extended Press and Schechter (EPS) formalism, adapted to a Lagrangian
picture. For regions exceeding a collapse threshold in the density smoothed at
a radius $R$, we consider all particles within a radius $R$ collapsed.
Exploiting a multi-scale smoothing of the initial density, we build a halo
catalogue on the fly by optimizing the selection of halo candidates. This
allows us to generate a density field with a halo mass function that matches
one measured in $N$-body simulations. We further explicitly gather particles in
each halo together in a profile, providing a numerical, Lagrangian-based
implementation of the halo model. Compared to previous semi-analytical
Lagrangian methods, we find that \muscleups\ improves the recovery of the
statistics of the density field at the level of the probability density
function (PDF), the power spectrum, and the cross correlation with the $N$-body
result.

          <p>We present a novel and remarkably simple formulation of degenerate
higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories whose Lagrangian is quadratic in
second derivatives of some scalar field. Using disformal transformations of the
metric, we identify a special "frame" (or metric) for which the Lagrangian of
quadratic DHOST theories reduces to the usual Einstein-Hilbert term plus a few
terms that depend on simple geometric quantities characterizing the uniform
scalar field hypersurfaces. In particular, for quadratic DHOST theories in the
physically interesting class Ia, the Lagrangian simply consists of the
Einstein-Hilbert term plus a term proportional to the three-dimensional scalar
curvature of the uniform scalar field hypersurfaces. The classification of all
quadratic DHOST theories becomes particularly transparent in this geometric
reformulation, which also applies to scalar-tensor theories that are degenerate
only in the unitary gauge.
