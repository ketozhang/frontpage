          <p>The neutrino field is commonly assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous in the
early universe. However, due to the large neutrino density, a small
perturbation of the isotropy of the neutrino field could potentially be
amplified by the non-linear flavor mixing caused by neutrino self-interactions.
We carry out the first numerical simulations of the neutrino flavor evolution
in a multi-angle anisotropic setting. Due to the computational challenges
involved, we adopt a simplified framework consisting of a homogeneous universe
with two angle bins -- left and right moving modes -- for neutrinos and
antineutrinos, together with an approximate form for the collision term which
goes beyond the commonly adopted damping approximation. By assuming a small
initial left-right asymmetry of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-15})$, we convincingly
demonstrate that flavor evolution can be affected in both mass orderings, with
implications on the effective number of thermally excited neutrino species
($N_{\mathrm{eff}}$). Notably, the correction to $N_{\rm eff}$ is comparable to
higher order corrections from finite temperature QED effects in normal
ordering. In addition, by assuming an initial lepton asymmetry in the neutrino
sector of the same order as the baryon one [$\mathcal{O}(10^{-9})$], we find
that the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry grows leading to a spontaneous
$\mathcal{CP}$ symmetry breaking. This work clearly shows that it is imperative
to critically revisit standard assumptions concerning neutrino flavor mixing in
the early universe, especially in the light of possible implications on the
cosmological observables.

          <p>El Gordo (ACT-CL J0102-4915) is an extremely massive galaxy cluster ($M_{200}
\approx 3 \times 10^{15}$ $M_{\odot}$) at redshift $z = 0.87 $ composed of two
subclusters with mass ratio 3.6 merging at speed $V_{infall} \approx 2500$
km/s. Such a fast collision between individually rare massive clusters is
unexpected in Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology at such high
$z$. However, this is required for non-cosmological hydrodynamical simulations
of the merger to match its observed properties (Zhang et al. 2015). Here, we
determine the probability of finding a similar object in a $\Lambda$CDM context
using the Jubilee simulation box with side length $6 \, h^{-1}$ Gpc. We search
for galaxy cluster pairs that have turned around from the cosmic expansion with
properties similar to El Gordo in terms of total mass, mass ratio, redshift,
and collision velocity relative to virial velocity. We fit the distribution of
pair total mass quite accurately, with the fits used in two methods to infer
the probability of observing El Gordo in the surveyed region. The more
conservative (and detailed) method involves considering the expected
distribution of pairwise mass and redshift for analogue pairs with similar
dimensionless parameters to El Gordo in the past lightcone of a $z = 0$
observer. Detecting one pair with its mass and redshift rules out $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology at $6.16\sigma$. We also use the results of Kraljic &amp; Sarkar (2015)
to show that the Bullet Cluster is in $2.78\sigma$ tension once the sky
coverage of its discovery survey is accounted for. Using a $\chi^2$ approach,
the combined tension can be estimated as $6.43 \sigma$. Both collisions arise
naturally in a Milgromian dynamics (MOND) cosmology with light sterile
neutrinos.

lead to a variety of diverse phenomena in particle physics, astrophysics and
cosmology. Assuming their possible existence, we investigate the accumulation
and propagation of mCPs in matter, specifically inside the Earth. Even small
values of millicharge lead to sizeable scattering cross sections on atoms,
resulting in complete thermalization, and as a consequence, considerable
build-up of number densities of mCPs, especially for the values of masses of
GeV and higher when the evaporation becomes inhibited. Enhancement of mCP
densities compared to their galactic abundance, that can be as big as
$10^{14}$, leads to the possibility of new experimental probes for this model.
The annihilation of pairs of mCPs will result in new signatures for the large
volume detectors (such as Super-Kamiokande). Formation of bound states of
negatively charged mCPs with nuclei can be observed by direct dark matter
detection experiments. A unique probe of mCP can be developed using underground

          <p>A promising route for revealing the existence of dark matter structures on
mass scales smaller than the faintest galaxies is through their effect on
strong gravitational lenses. We examine the role of local, lens-proximate
clustering in boosting the lensing probability relative to contributions from
substructure and unclustered line-of-sight (LOS) halos. Using two cosmological
simulations that can resolve halo masses of $M_{\rm halo} \simeq 10^{9}\
M_{\odot}$ (in a simulation box of length $L_{\rm box}{\sim}100\,{\rm Mpc}$)
and $10^{7}\ M_{\odot}$ ($L_{\rm box}\sim20\,{\rm Mpc}$), we demonstrate that
clustering in the vicinity of the lens host produces a clear enhancement
relative to an assumption of unclustered halos that persists to $&gt; 20\,R_{\rm
vir}$. This enhancement exceeds estimates that use a two-halo term to account
for clustering, particularly within $2-5\,R_{\rm vir}$. We provide an analytic
expression for this excess, clustered contribution. We find that local
clustering boosts the expected count of $10^9 \ M_\odot$ perturbing halos by
${\sim}35\%$ compared to substructure alone, a result that will significantly
enhance expected signals for low-redshift ($z_l \simeq 0.2$) lenses, where
substructure contributes substantially compared to LOS halos. We also find that
the orientation of the lens with respect to the line of sight (e.g., whether
the line of sight passes through the major axis of the lens) can also have a
significant effect on the lensing signal, boosting counts by an additional
$\sim 50\%$ compared to a random orientations.

          <p>The standard theoretical description $\Theta(\hat n)$ of the observed CMB
temperature anisotropies is gauge-dependent. It is, however, well known that
the gauge mode is limited to the monopole and the higher angular multipoles
$\Theta_l$ ($l\geq1$) are gauge-invariant. Several attempts have been made in
the past to properly define the monopole fluctuation, but the resulting values
of the monopole power $C_0$ are infinite due to the infrared divergences. The
infrared divergences arise from the contribution of the uniform gravitational
potential to the monopole fluctuation, in violation of the equivalence
principle. Here we present the gauge-invariant theoretical description of the
observed CMB temperature anisotropies and compute the monopole power
$C_0=1.66\times10^{-9}$ in a $\Lambda$CDM model. While the gauge-dependence in
the standard calculations originates from the ambiguity in defining the
hypersurface for the background CMB temperature $\bar T$ today, it is in fact
well defined and one of the fundamental cosmological parameters. Adopting
simple approximations for the anisotropy formation, we derive a gauge-invariant
analytical expression for the observed CMB temperature anisotropies to study
the CMB monopole fluctuation and the cancellation of the uniform gravitational
potential contributions on large scales.

physics in the dark matter power spectrum, concentrating here on evolving dark
energy and modifications to General Relativity. After introducing a new
technique to quantify classification uncertainty in BNNs, we train two BNNs on
mock matter power spectra produced using the publicly available code
$\tt{ReACT}$ in the $k$-range $\left(0.01 - 2.5\right) \, h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} $
and redshift bins $\left(0.1,0.478,0.783,1.5\right)$ with Euclid-like noise.
The first network classifies spectra into five labels including $\Lambda$CDM,
$f(R)$, $w$CDM, Dvali-Gabadaze-Porrati (DGP) gravity and a "random" class
whereas the second is trained to distinguish $\Lambda$CDM from
non-$\Lambda$CDM. Both networks achieve a comparable training, validation and
test accuracy of $\sim 95\%$. Each network is also capable of detecting
deviations from $\Lambda$CDM that were not included in the training set,
demonstrated with spectra generated using the growth-index $\gamma$. We then
quantify the constraining power of each network by computing the smallest
deviation from $\Lambda$CDM such that the noise-averaged non-$\Lambda$CDM
classification probability is at least $2\sigma$, finding these bounds to be
$f_{R0} \lesssim 10^{-7}$, $\Omega_{rc} \lesssim 10^{-2} $, $-1.05 \lesssim w_0
\lesssim 0.95 $, $-0.2 \lesssim w_a \lesssim 0.2 $, $0.52 \lesssim \gamma
\lesssim 0.59 $. The bounds on $f(R)$ can be improved by training a specialist
network to distinguish solely between $\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$ power spectra
which can detect a non-zero $f_{R0}$ at $\mathcal{O}\left(10^{-8}\right)$ with
a confidence $&gt;2\sigma$. We expect that further developments, such as the
inclusion of smaller length scales or additional extensions to $\Lambda$CDM,
will only improve the potential of BNNs to detect new physics using
cosmological datasets.

          <p>The most robust prediction of inflationary cosmology is the existence of a
red tilt for the spectrum of curvature fluctuations that is experimentally of
order $0.04$. The tilt is derived solving the exact equation for quantum
fluctuations in a quasi de Sitter background defined by a equation of state
$\epsilon \equiv \frac{(p+\rho)}{\rho}$ with $\epsilon$ small but non
vanishing. The experimental data selects among the different quasi de Sitter
inflaton potentials. The origin of the lack of scale invariance associated with
the tilt is however classical in essence and parametrized by the slow roll of
the inflaton potential. Here we present a purely quantum mechanical and model
independent derivation of the tilt. This derivation is based on two basic
observations: first, the correlator for gauge invariant variables is related to
the {\it quantum Fisher function} measuring the quantum dependence of the
family of pure de Sitter vacua on the energy scale parameter; second, this
quantum Fisher function has a non vanishing scale dependent red tilt that, at
the energy scales of physical interest, fits the effective quasi de Sitter
prediction as well as the experimental value. This is a result that is model
independent and only based on the quantum features of the family of de Sitter
vacua.

          <p>Measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ forest based on large numbers of quasar
spectra from sky surveys such as SDSS/eBOSS accurately probe the distribution
of matter on small scales and thus provide important constraints on several
ingredients of the cosmological model. A main summary statistic derived from
those measurements is the one-dimensional power spectrum, P1D, of the
Ly$\alpha$ absorption. However, model predictions for P1D rely on expensive
hydrodynamical simulations of the intergalactic medium, which was the limiting
factor in previous analyses. Datasets from upcoming surveys such as DESI will
push observational accuracy near the 1%-level and probe even smaller scales.
This observational push mandate seven more accurate simulations as well as more
careful exploration of parameter space. In this work we evaluate the robustness
and accuracy of simulations and the statistical framework used to constrain
cosmological parameters. We present a comparison between the grid-based
simulation code Nyx and SPH-based code Gadget in the context ofP1D. In
addition, we perform resolution and box-size convergence tests using Nyx code.
We use a Gaussian process emulation scheme to reduce the number of simulations
required for exploration of parameter space without sacrificing the model
accuracy. We demonstrate the ability to produce unbiased parameter constraints
in an end-to-end inference test using mock eBOSS- and DESI-like data, and we
advocate for the usage of adaptive sampling schemes as opposed to using a fixed

          <p>Internal Linear Combination (ILC) methods are some of the most widely used
multi-frequency cleaning techniques employed in CMB data analysis. These
methods reduce foregrounds by minimizing the total variance in the coadded map
(subject to a signal-preservation constraint), although often significant
foreground residuals or biases remain. A modification to the ILC method is the
constrained ILC (cILC), which explicitly nulls certain foreground components;
however, this foreground nulling often comes at a high price for ground-based
CMB datasets, with the map noise increasing significantly on small scales. In
this paper we explore a new method, the partially constrained ILC (pcILC),
which allows us to optimize the tradeoff between foreground bias and variance
in ILC methods. In particular, this method allows us to minimize the variance
subject to an inequality constraint requiring that the constrained foregrounds
are reduced by at least a fixed factor, which can be chosen based on the
foreground sensitivity of the intended application. We test our method on
simulated sky maps for a Simons Observatory-like experiment; we find that for
cleaning thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) contamination at $\ell \in
[3000,4800]$, if a small tSZ residual of 20% of the standard ILC residual can
be tolerated, the variance of the CMB temperature map is reduced by at least
50% over the cILC value. We also demonstrate an application of this method to
reduce noise in CMB lensing reconstruction.

direct evidence for the inflationary paradigm of the origin of the Universe.
The BICEP/Keck Array (BK) program targets the degree angular scales, where the
power from primordial $B$-mode polarization is expected to peak, with
ever-increasing sensitivity and has published the most stringent constraints on
inflation to date. BICEP Array (BA) is the Stage-3 instrument of the BK program
and will comprise four BICEP3-class receivers observing at 30/40, 95, 150 and
220/270 GHz with a combined 32,000+ detectors; such wide frequency coverage is
necessary for control of the Galactic foregrounds, which also produce
degree-scale $B$-mode signal. The 30/40 GHz receiver is designed to constrain
the synchrotron foreground and has begun observing at the South Pole in early
2020. By the end of a 3-year observing campaign, the full BICEP Array
instrument is projected to reach $\sigma_r$ between 0.002 and 0.004, depending
on foreground complexity and degree of removal of $B$-modes due to
gravitational lensing (delensing). This paper presents an overview of the

We also give a preview of the added complexity in the time-domain multiplexed

          <p>Dark Yang-Mills sectors, which are ubiquitous in the string landscape, may be
reheated above their critical temperature and subsequently go through a
confining first-order phase transition that produces stochastic gravitational
waves in the early universe. Taking into account constraints from lattice and
from Yang-Mills (center and Weyl) symmetries, we use a phenomenological model
to construct an effective potential of the semi quark-gluon plasma phase, from
which we compute the gravitational wave signal produced during confinement for
numerous gauge groups. The signal is maximized when the dark sector dominates
the energy density of the universe at the time of the phase transition. In that
case, we find that it is within reach of the next-to-next generation of
experiments (BBO, DECIGO) for a range of dark confinement scales near the weak
scale.

          <p>Intrinsic galaxy alignments yield an important contribution to the observed
statistics of galaxy shapes. The general bias expansion for galaxy sizes and
shapes in three dimensions has been recently described by Vlah, Chisari \&amp;
Schmidt using the general perturbative effective field theory (EFT) framework,
in analogy to the clustering of galaxies. In this work, we present a formalism
that uses the properties of spherical tensors to project galaxy shapes onto the
observed sky in the flat-sky approximation and compute the two-point functions
at next-to-leading order as well as the leading-order three-point functions of
galaxy shapes and number counts. The resulting expressions are given in forms
that are convenient for efficient numerical implementation. For a source
redshift distribution typical of Stage IV surveys, we find that that nonlinear
intrinsic alignment contributions to galaxy shape correlations become relevant
at angular wavenumbers $l \gtrsim 100$.

          <p>The phase-space structure of primordial dark matter halos is revisited using
cosmological simulations with three sine waves and Cold Dark Matter (CDM)
initial conditions. The simulations are performed with the tessellation based
Vlasov solver ColDICE and a Particle-Mesh (PM) $N$-body code. The analyses
include projected density, phase-space diagrams, radial density and
pseudo-phase space density. Particular attention is paid to force and mass
resolution. Because the phase-space sheet complexity, estimated in terms of
total volume and simplices count, increases very quickly, ColDICE can follow
only the early violent relaxation phase of halo formation. During the latter,
agreement between ColDICE and PM simulations having one particle per cell or
more is excellent and halos have a power-law density profile, $\rho(r) \propto
r^{-\alpha}$, $\alpha \in [1.5,1.8]$. This slope, measured prior to any merger,
is slightly larger than in the literature. The phase-space diagrams evidence
complex but coherent patterns with clear signatures of self-similarity in the
sine wave simulations, while the CDM halos are somewhat scribbly. After
additional mass resolution tests, the PM simulations are used to follow the
next stages of evolution. The power-law progressively breaks down with a
convergence of the density profile to the well known "NFW"-like universal
attractor, irrespectively of initial conditions, that is even in the three-sine
wave simulations. This demonstrates again that mergers do not represent a
necessary condition for convergence to the dynamical attractor. Not
surprisingly, the measured pseudo phase-space density is a power-law $Q(r)
\propto r^{-\alpha_Q}$, with $\alpha_{\rm Q}$ close to the prediction of
secondary spherical infall model, $\alpha_{\rm Q} \simeq 1.875$. However this
property is also verified during the early relaxation phase, which is non
trivial.

mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and the central velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) and, for
core-S\'ersic galaxies, the size of the depleted core ($R_{\rm b}$). Our sample
of 144 galaxies with dynamically determined $M_{\rm BH}$ encompasses 24
core-S\'ersic galaxies, thought to be products of gas-poor mergers, and
reliably identified based on high-resolution HST imaging. For core-S\'ersic
galaxies -- i.e., combining normal-core ($R_{\rm b} &lt; 0.5 $ kpc) and large-core
galaxies ($R_{\rm b} \gtrsim 0.5$ kpc), we find that $M_{\rm BH}$ correlates
remarkably well with $R_{\rm b}$ such that $M_{\rm BH} \propto R_{\rm b}^{1.20
\pm 0.14}$ (rms scatter in log $M_{\rm BH}$ of $\Delta_{\rm rms} \sim 0.29$
dex), confirming previous works on the same galaxies except three new ones.
Separating the sample into S\'ersic, normal-core and large-core galaxies, we
find that S\'ersic and normal-core galaxies jointly define a single log-linear
$M_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ relation $M_{\rm BH} \propto \sigma^{ 4.88 \pm 0.29}$ with
$\Delta_{\rm rms} \sim 0.47$ dex, however, at the high-mass end large-core
galaxies (four with measured $M_{\rm BH}$) are offset upward from this relation
by ($2.5-4) \times \sigma_{\rm s}$, explaining the previously reported
steepening of the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ relation for massive galaxies. Large-core
spheroids have magnitudes $M_{V} \le -23.50$ mag, half-light radii Re $&gt;$ 10

spheroids tend to host ultramassive BHs ($M_{\rm BH} \ge 10^{10}M_{\odot}$)
tightly connected with their $R_{\rm b}$ rather than $\sigma$. The less popular
$M_{\rm BH}-R_{\rm b}$ relation exhibits $\sim$ 62% less scatter in log $M_{\rm

          <p>The nature of dark matter and of dark energy which constitute more than
$95\%$ of the energy in the Universe remains a great and unresolved question in
cosmology. Cold dark matter can be made of an ultralight scalar field dominated
by its mass term which interacts only gravitationally. The cosmological
constant introduced to explain the recent acceleration of the Universe
expansion can be easily replaced by a scalar field dominated by its potential.
More generally, scalar fields are ubiquitous in cosmology: inflaton, dilatons,
moduli, quintessence, fuzzy dark matter, dark fluid, etc. are some examples.
One can wonder whether all these scalar fields are independent. The dark fluid
model aims at unifying quintessence and fuzzy dark matter models with a unique
scalar field. One step futher is to unify the dark fluid model with inflation.
In the very early Universe such scalar fields are not strongly constrained by
direct observations, but Big-Bang nucleosynthesis set constraints on scalar
field models which lead to a modification on the abundance of the elements. In
this talk we will present a scalar field model unifying dark matter, dark
energy and inflation, and study constraints from Big-Bang nucleosynthesis on
primordial scalar fields.

          <p>Halo occupation distribution (HOD) models describe the number of galaxies
that reside in different haloes, and are widely used in galaxy-halo connection
studies using the halo model (HM). Here, we introduce and study HOD response
functions $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ that describe the response of the HODs to
long-wavelength perturbations $\mathcal{O}$. The linear galaxy bias parameters
$b_\mathcal{O}^g$ are a weighted version of $b_\mathcal{O}^h +
R_\mathcal{O}^g$, where $b_\mathcal{O}^h$ is the halo bias, but the
contribution from $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ is routinely ignored in the literature. We
investigate the impact of this by measuring the $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ in separate
universe simulations of the IllustrisTNG model for three types of
perturbations: total matter perturbations, $\mathcal{O}=\delta_m$; baryon-CDM
compensated isocurvature perturbations, $\mathcal{O}=\sigma$; and potential
perturbations with local primordial non-Gaussianity, $\mathcal{O}\propto f_{\rm
NL}\phi$. Our main takeaway message is that the $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ are not
negligible in general and their size should be estimated on a case-by-case
basis. For stellar-mass selected galaxies, the responses $R_\phi^g$ and
$R_\sigma^g$ are sizeable and cannot be neglected in HM calculations of the
bias parameters $b_\phi^g$ and $b_\sigma^g$; this is relevant for constraint
studies of inflation. On the other hand, we do not detect a strong impact of
the HOD response $R_1^g$ on the linear galaxy bias $b_1^g$. These results can
be explained by the impact that the perturbations have on stellar-to-total-mass
relations. We also look into the impact on the bias of the gas distribution and
find similar conclusions. We show that a single extra parameter describing the
overall amplitude of $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ recovers the measured $b_\mathcal{O}^g$
well, which indicates that $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ can be easily added to HM/HOD
studies as a new ingredient.

          <p>We present a mitigation strategy to reduce the impact of non-linear galaxy
bias on the joint `$3 \times 2 $pt' cosmological analysis of weak lensing and
galaxy surveys. The $\Psi$-statistics that we adopt are based on Complete
Orthogonal Sets of E/B Integrals (COSEBIs). As such they are designed to
minimise the contributions to the observable from the smallest physical scales
where models are highly uncertain. We demonstrate that $\Psi$-statistics carry
the same constraining power as the standard two-point galaxy clustering and
galaxy-galaxy lensing statistics, but are significantly less sensitive to
scale-dependent galaxy bias. Using two galaxy bias models, motivated by
halo-model fits to data and simulations, we quantify the error in a standard $3
\times 2$pt analysis where constant galaxy bias is assumed. Even when adopting
conservative angular scale cuts, that degrade the overall cosmological
parameter constraints, we find of order $1 \sigma$ biases for Stage III surveys
on the cosmological parameter $S_8 = \sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{\alpha}$.
This arises from a leakage of the smallest physical scales to all angular
scales in the standard two-point correlation functions. In contrast, when
analysing $\Psi$-statistics under the same approximation of constant galaxy
bias, we show that the bias on the recovered value for $S_8$ can be decreased
by a factor of $\sim 2$, with less conservative scale cuts. Given the
challenges in determining accurate galaxy bias models in the highly non-linear
regime, we argue that $3 \times 2$pt analyses should move towards new
statistics that are less sensitive to the smallest physical scales.

          <p>A covariant modified gravity (MOG) is formulated by adding to general
relativity two new degrees of freedom, a scalar field gravitational coupling
strength $G= 1/\chi$ and a gravitational spin 1 vector field $\phi_\mu$. The
$G$ is written as $G=G_N(1+\alpha)$ where $G_N$ is Newton's constant, and the
gravitational source charge for the vector field is $Q_g=\sqrt{\alpha G_N}M$,
where $M$ is the mass of a body. Cosmological solutions of the theory are
derived in a homogeneous and isotropic cosmology. Black holes in MOG are
stationary as the end product of gravitational collapse and are axisymmetric
solutions with spherical topology. It is shown that the scalar field $\chi$ is
constant everywhere for an isolated black hole with asymptotic flat boundary
condition. A consequence of this is that the scalar field loses its monopole
moment radiation.

          <p>We present weak lensing shear catalogues from the fourth data release of the
Kilo-Degree Survey, KiDS-1000, spanning 1006 square degrees of deep and
high-resolution imaging. Our `gold-sample' of galaxies, with well-calibrated
photometric redshift distributions, consists of 21 million galaxies with an
effective number density of $6.17$ galaxies per square arcminute. We quantify
the accuracy of the spatial, temporal, and flux-dependent point-spread function
(PSF) model, verifying that the model meets our requirements to induce less
than a $0.1\sigma$ change in the inferred cosmic shear constraints on the
clustering cosmological parameter $S_8 = \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$.
Through a series of two-point null-tests, we validate the shear estimates,
finding no evidence for significant non-lensing B-mode distortions in the data.
The PSF residuals are detected in the highest-redshift bins, originating from
object selection and/or weight bias. The amplitude is, however, shown to be
sufficiently low and within our stringent requirements. With a shear-ratio
null-test, we verify the expected redshift scaling of the galaxy-galaxy lensing
signal around luminous red galaxies. We conclude that the joint KiDS-1000 shear
and photometric redshift calibration is sufficiently robust for combined-probe
gravitational lensing and spectroscopic clustering analyses.

          <p>As spectroscopic surveys continue to grow in size, the problem of classifying
spectra targeted as quasars (QSOs) will need to move beyond its historical
reliance on human experts. Instead, automatic classifiers will increasingly
become the dominant classification method, leaving only small fractions of
spectra to be visually inspected in ambiguous cases. In order to maximise
classification accuracy, making best use of available classifiers will be of
great importance, particularly when looking to identify and eliminate
distinctive failure modes. In this work, we demonstrate that the machine
learning-based classifier QuasarNET will be of use for future surveys such as
the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), comparing its performance to
the DESI pipeline classifier redrock. During the first of four passes across
its footprint DESI will need to select high-$z$ ($z\geq2.1$) QSOs for
reobservation, and so we first assess the classifiers' performance at
identifying high-$z$ QSOs from single-exposure spectra. We then quantify the
classifiers' abilities to construct QSO catalogues in both low- and high-$z$
bins, using coadded spectra to simulate end-of-survey data. For such tasks,
QuasarNET is able to outperform redrock in its current form, identifying
approximately 99% of high-$z$ QSOs from single exposures and producing QSO
catalogues with sub-percent levels of contamination. By combining QuasarNET and
redrock's outputs, we can further improve the classification strategies to
identify up to 99.5% of high-$z$ QSOs from single exposures and reduce final
QSO catalogue contamination to below 0.5%. These combined strategies address
DESI's QSO classification needs effectively.

observations from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000), with redshift-space
galaxy clustering observations from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
(BOSS), and galaxy-galaxy lensing observations from the overlap between
KiDS-1000, BOSS and the spectroscopic 2-degree Field Lensing Survey (2dFLenS).
This combination of large-scale structure probes breaks the degeneracies
between cosmological parameters for individual observables, resulting in a
constraint on the structure growth parameter $S_8=\sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm
m}/0.3} = 0.766^{+0.020}_{-0.014}$, that has the same overall precision as that
reported by the full-sky cosmic microwave background observations from Planck.
The recovered $S_8$ amplitude is low, however, by $8.3 \pm 2.6$ % relative to
Planck. This result builds from a series of KiDS-1000 analyses where we
validate our methodology with variable depth mock galaxy surveys, our lensing
calibration with image simulations and null-tests, and our
optical-to-near-infrared redshift calibration with multi-band mock catalogues
and a spectroscopic-photometric clustering analysis. The systematic
uncertainties identified by these analyses are folded through as nuisance
parameters in our cosmological analysis. Inspecting the offset between the
marginalised posterior distributions, we find that the $S_8$-difference with
Planck is driven by a tension in the matter fluctuation amplitude parameter,
$\sigma_8$. We quantify the level of agreement between the CMB and our
large-scale structure constraints using a series of different metrics, finding
differences with a significance ranging between $\sim\! 3\,\sigma$, when
considering the offset in $S_{8}$, and $\sim\! 2\,\sigma$, when considering the
full multi-dimensional parameter space.

of clusters as a function of flux also agrees with previous measurements.
Finally, we obtain a scatter of 0.21 (0.07, 0.25) for the X-ray luminosity --

We provide catalogues with the model photons emitted by clusters and active

          <p>Axion couplings to photons could induce photon-axion conversion in the
presence of magnetic fields in the Universe. The conversion could impact
various cosmic distance measurements such as luminosity distances to type Ia
supernovae and angular distances to galaxy clusters in different ways. We
consider different combinations of the most updated distance measurements to
constrain the axion-photon coupling. Ignoring the conversion in intracluster
medium (ICM), we find the upper bounds on axion-photon couplings to be around
$5 \times 10^{-12}$ (nG/$B$) GeV$^{-1}$ for axion mass below $5 \times
10^{-13}$ eV, where $B$ is the strength of the magnetic field in the
intergalactic medium (IGM). When including the conversion in ICM, the upper
bound gets stronger and could reach $5 \times 10^{-13} $GeV$^{-1}$ for $m_a &lt; 5
\times 10^{-12}$ eV. While this stronger bound moderately depends on the ICM
modeling, it is independent of the IGM parameters. All the bounds are
determined by the shape of Hubble rate as a function of redshift
reconstructable from various distance measurements, and insensitive to today's
Hubble rate, of which there is a tension between early and late cosmological
measurements. As an appendix, we discuss model building challenges to use
photon-axion conversion to make type Ia supernovae brighter to alleviate the
Hubble problem/crisis.

          <p>Primordial black holes are analytically and numerically discussed based on
the extended McVittie spacetime solution. By assuming that dark matter and
radiation are the only sources of energy accreted by the forming central
object, it is found that the black-hole mass evolution depends on the initial
mass of the seed, the time in which the black hole emerges, and also on the
average peculiar velocity of dark matter particles. Constraints on the initial
conditions of the primordial black holes are derived from profiles of the
black-hole accretion mechanism and cosmological environment. A large range of
masses is compatible with our approach. In particular, masses of the order of
$10^{10}M_{\odot}$ today may also be generated from small seeds. An incubation
time for the emerging horizons is observed when the initial masses of the seeds
are close to the particle-horizon mass. It is also argued that the
McVittie-type description is consistent with the Schwarzschild solution as long
as other astrophysical processes near the central object are neglected.

          <p>Studies of intrinsic alignment effects mostly focus on the correlations
between shapes of galaxies with each other, or with the underlying density
field of the large scale structure of the universe. Lately, the correlation
between shapes of galaxies and the large-scale velocity field has been proposed
as an additional probe of the large scale structure. We use a Fisher forecast
to make a prediction for the detectability of this velocity-shape correlation
with a combination of redshifts and shapes from the 4MOST+LSST surveys, and
radial velocity reconstruction from the Simons Observatory. The signal-to-noise
ratio for the velocity-shape (dipole) correlation is 23, relative to 44 for the
galaxy density-shape (monopole) correlation and for a maximum wavenumber of
$0.2\: \mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$. Increasing signal-to-noise for higher values of the
maximum wavenumbers (respectively, 56 and 69, for a maximum wavenumber of $1\:
\mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$) indicate potential gains in the nonlinear regime.
Encouraged by these predictions, we discuss two possible applications for the
velocity-shape correlation. Measuring the velocity-shape correlation could
improve the mitigation of selection effects induced by intrinsic alignments on
galaxy clustering. We also find that velocity-shape measurements could
potentially aid in determining the scale-dependence of intrinsic alignments
when multiple shape measurements of the same galaxies are provided.

          <p>The correlation between the peak spectra energy and the equivalent isotropic
energy of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the so-called Amati relation, is often
used to constrain the high-redshift Hubble diagram of the universe. Assuming
Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, Wang et al. found a $\gtrsim
3\sigma$ tension in the data-calibrated Amati coefficients between low- and
high-redshift GRB samples. To test whether beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology could
resolve the tension, we use PAge approximation, an almost model-independent
cosmology framework to revisit the redshift evolution of Amati relation. We
find that the low- and high-redshift tension of Amati relation remains at $\sim
3\sigma$ level in the PAge framework. Thus, for the broad class of models
covered by PAge approximation, caution needs to be taken for the use of GRBs as
high-redshift distance indicators.
